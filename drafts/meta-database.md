Metabase is a DBMS-independent PHP API to access SQL databases. It
supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, Microsoft
Access, ODBC, Interbase, Informix, MiniSQL, and SQLite. It supports
nested transactions, blobs, and prepared queries. It can install
database schemas defined in a DBMS independent XML format that
describe tables, indexes, primary keys, and auto-increment sequences.
It is also able to upgrade a database to a new schema without
affecting the data that was stored since it was installed or
upgraded for the last time. There is also schema reverse engineering
support.

This allows the Database schema to be imported into a Version Control System (e.g. Git)
