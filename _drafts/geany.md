title: Geany text editor
---

So after over 30 years of using GNU emacs as my go-to editor I have finally switched to [Geany](https://www.geany.org/).

So, essentially, nowadays, I use two editor, `vi` that comes with `busybox` and `geany`.  The only thing that I miss from 
this set-up is the lack of `macro` recording.


Still todo:

- macro recording
- handling of split screens is a bit wonky
