<span style="color: #000000">Mix it 50/50 water and vinegar, bring it to a boil, shut it off and let it soak for 15 minutes or so. Yes, you will have to rinse it several times to get the vinegar smell out. If the 50/50 mix doesn't work, try it again full strength. </span>

Optionally, afterwards put lemon juice (one part lemon 2 parts water) boil it again and empty. The smell is fine and it is super clean.
