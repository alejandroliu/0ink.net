I bought a HP Envy 4504.  Overall I am happy with it.  This is how
I configure it so I can use with Linux.

This mini howto applies to ArchLinux and Centos/RedHat distributions.


Packages: Archlinux:

    cups, hplip, python2, sane
    

Centos: `cups, hplip, hplip-gui, sane` Some optional dependancies may be needed. Enter:

    sudo systemctl enable cups
    sudo systemctl start cups
    sudo hp-setup
    

hp-setup -i Select "Network", and "Advanced Options -> Manual Discovery" Printer: npr1 PPD File:

    /usr/share/ppd/HP/hp-envy_4500_series.ppd
    

Uncoment `hpaio` from `/etc/sane/dll.conf`. Some commands:

    cupsenable printer
    lpstat -p
    lpadmin -p PrinterName -E

Also since it is a WIFI printer normally it will go into sleep/power
save mode. This means if you then try to print from cups it will fail
(printer is asleep). Subsequent prints should work but now cupsd has
flagged the printer as paused. To prevent this you should configure
the default `ErrorPolicy` in `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` by adding in the top
scope:

    ErrorPolicy retry-job
