So it is is a more dangerous world out there. You can start securing web sites using self signed certificates. Another option is to:

1.  Use CloudFlare. This will use a CF certificate from the CF CDN to the web site, while using a self-signed certificate between the CF CDN to your web server.
2.  Use [startssl](https://www.startssl.com/)
