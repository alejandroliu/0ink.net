Today I want to briefly write about [kivy][ki].  [kivy][ki] is an
[Python][py] library intended for developing Mobile Apps.  It is a
cross-platform library that runs on [Android][ad], [iOS][ios],
[Linux][li], [OS X][osx] and [Windows][win].  It is licensed under
the [MIT][mit], so it is free and open source.

[Kivy][ki] is the main framework developed by the [Kivy organisation][ko], alongside with [Python for Android][pa],
[Kivy iOS][ks] and other libraries meant to be used in all platforms.  It is compatible with Python2 and Python3,
as well as having support for the Raspberry Pi.

The framework contains all the elements for building an application such as:

* extensive input support for mouse, keyboard, TUIO, and OS-specific multitouch events,
* a graphic library using only OpenGL ES 2, and based on Vertex Buffer Object and shaders,
* a wide range of Widgets that support multitouch,
* an intermediate language [kv][kv] used to easily design custom Widgets.
