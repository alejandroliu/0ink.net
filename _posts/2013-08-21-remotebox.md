<a href="http://knobgoblin.org.uk/" title="RemoteBox">RemoteBox</a> is a Remote VirtualBox UI.
It is similar <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvirtualbox/" title="phpVirtualBox">phpVirtualBox</a>  in that allows to manage 
VirtualBox remotely (on a potentially headless server).
They differ in their requirements:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://knobgoblin.org.uk/" title="RemoteBox">RemoteBox</a> does not require much on the server, but you
need to install it on the client.</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvirtualbox/" title="phpVirtualBox">phpVirtualBox</a> only requires a browser and rdp viewer
on the client, but requires a web server with PHP support
on the server.</li>
</ul>
