<h2>Procedures for Previous versions of Outlook</h2>

This is my procedure for cleaning my Outlook calendar from old appointments and other assorted outdated stuff:

<ol>
<li>Backup your calendar folder (just in case)</li>
<li>Create a temporary Calendar folder</li>
<li>Select your default Calendar</li>
<li>Switch to <code>All Appointments</code> view:

<ul>
<li>View -&gt; Current View -&gt; All Appointments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select all the appointments and <strong>move</strong> them to the temporary
Calendar folder</li>
<li>Select the temporary Calendar folder</li>
<li>Switch to <code>Active Appointments</code> vew:

<ul>
<li>View -&gt; Current View -&gt; Active Appointments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select all the visible appointments and <strong>move</strong> the m back to
the default Calendar folder.</li>
<li>You can now dispose of the temporary folder (or backed it up
for reference.</li>
</ol>
