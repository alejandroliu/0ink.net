So I started using my GrandStream IP phone.  No big deal, did what it was supposed to do.  One <em>interesting</em> feature is that it can show the current weather in the LCD screen.  It would auto-detect location by your Internet IP.  If you want more granular addressing, you can specify a city code.  You can find city codes using this link.
