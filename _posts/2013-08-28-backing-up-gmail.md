The other day I found <a href="http://gmvault.org/index.html">Gmvault</a>.

Gmvault is an open source Gmail backup software written in Python.

This article provides a good overview on how it works (found it better than the Gmvault documentation):

<ul>
<li><a href="http://xmodulo.com/2013/08/how-to-back-up-and-restore-gmail-account-on-linux.html">How to back up and restore Gmail account on Linux</a></li>
</ul>

It uses IMAP to connect to Gmail and also stores files in <code>.eml</code> (plain text) formatted fails.  It has a converter to export to mbox and Maildir formats.

Probably would be good for archiving and using <a href="http://freecode.com/projects/udmsearch">mnoGoSearch</a> for search front end.
