So one weekend went by and managed to finish up my `0ink.net` web site. So now I have:

*   [wordpress](http://wordpress.org/)  
    For main content.
*   [tt-rss](http://tt-rss.org/)  
    This is my answer to Google's shutdown of the Reader service.
*   Automated backups  
    Through my own custom scripts.
*   New e-mail server
*   [sitecopy](http://www.manyfish.co.uk/sitecopy/)  
    To manage the web software updates.
*   [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com/)  
    Reverse proxy and web accelerator.
