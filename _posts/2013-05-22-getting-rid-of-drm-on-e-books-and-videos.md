<h1>How to Remove DRM from Ebooks (and Back Up Your Library Permanently)</h1>

The easiest way to strip DRM from Kindle books (and Barnes and Noble, Adobe Digital Content, etc) is with the free ebook software Calibre, DRM removal plugins, and a copy of the Kindle desktop software (PC/Mac). These directions are for Kindle, but will work with Barnes and Noble, Adobe Digital Editions, and older formats. Here's what you need to do:

<ol>
<li>Download Calibre, the the plugins, and the Kindle Desktop software.</li>
<li>Unzip the contents of the plugin directory.</li>
<li>Open up Calibre and click on <code>"Preferences."</code></li>
<li>Navigate to <code>"Plugins"</code> under the <code>"Advanced"</code> section.</li>
<li>Click <code>"Load Plugin from file,"</code> and select <code>K3MobiDeDRM_v04.5_plugin.zip</code> from the directory you just unzipped.</li>
<li>Load up the Kindle app on your Mac or Windows computer and download all your books from Amazon.</li>
<li>Navigate to either <code>C:Users[your username]DocumentsMy Kindle Content</code> on Windows or <code>[your username]My DocumentsMy Kindle Content</code> on Mac.</li>
<li>Your books aren't named in any meaningful way, so just drag all the <code>*.azw</code> files into Calibre.</li>
<li>After a short wait (depending on the size of your library), Calibre will finish importing the books. Now you have a DRM-free backup of all your books on your computer.</li>
</ol>

It's a little convoluted, but once you get the hang of it, Calibre is a solid way to backup all your purchased ebooks.

<h1>How to Remove DRM from Movies and TV Shows</h1>

You can record directly from your computer using a screen recording tool (any of these <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5839047/five-best-screencasting-or-screen-recording-tools">five</a> will do).
You will, of course, have to wait for the entire movie since it operates essentially like dubbing, but if you already use screen recording tools it's a free option for backing up your movies.
