Want to share your family photos after your death, but take your
search history to the grave? All that and more is possible with
Google's Inactive Account Manager.

## How You Can Control Your Information After Death

It's not nice to think about, but one day, you will die, along with
the keys to your online kingdom. And these days, those online accounts
can hold a lot of stuff you may want to pass on.

Your Google account has a feature tucked deep in the bowels of your
account settings called "Inactive Account Manager". Although the
feature is several years old now, it's practically unknown among
Google usersâ€“in a casual survey of people outside our office who had
Google accounts, not one of them was aware of the feature.

Inactive Account Manager is what fans of old spy movies and
psychological thrillers will immediately recognize as a "dead man's
switch". Once activated if you do not interact with your Google
account in X amount of time, then Google's servers will automatically
either notify your trusted contacts and/or share specified data with
those select contacts. Or, at your instruction, it can wipe your account.

In this way, you can ensure that things like family photos stored in
Google Photos are available to your family, that your spouse can will
have full access to your contacts to manage your business affairs, or
that anyone you wish to share your account with upon your demise or
incapacitation can access it legitimately and without resorting to
masquerading themselves as you.

## Setting Up the Inactive Account Manager

To set up Inactive Account Manager, make sure you're logged into your
Google account and visit this [page](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/account/inactive).

You can supply a contact phone number for the person (don't worry, they
won't get an immediate text indicating that you've selected them, so
there won't be any awkward conversations about death triggered by
this process). Then you need to specify what Google data you want to
share with them. We'd encourage you to apply this step selectively,
and not simply check "Select all". Most of us would happily share our
Google Photo collections with our next of kin, after all, but would
prefer to take our search histories private.

The final step is the weightiest one: selecting whether or not your
Google account will be wiped upon the completion of the timeout period.

There is no option to partially delete the data, so make this very
binary decision with care. You cannot, for example, wipe your search
history and email but leave your YouTube content and Blogger posts
intact for posterity. Once the countdown is complete, like a real
dead man's switch, the account data is gone forever.
