Around April 2023, I decided to look for a new [Linux Desktop Environment][de] for my
personal [void linux][void].  So I tried these distros:

- [lxqt][lxqt]: This is the one I eventually chose to switch to.  I liked it that it
  was very small and light, and very modular, almost like a kit that you assemble
  yourself.  Because I have thinking for some time that I would like to make my
  own [Desktop environment][de] from a [Window Manager][wm], [lxqt][lxqt] is very close
  to what I wanted to do with that idea.
  - **PROS**:
    - Light and modular
    - Classic User Experience (great since I am very old computer user).
    - Uses [XScreenSaver][xscreensaver]
    - Uses QT widget set.
  - **CONS**
    - not as visually appealing as the other desktops here.
- [MATE Desktop][mate]: This is the desktop that I was using before.  It is light on
  resources and has all the features you would expect.  Nothing against it, but I thought
  it was time to move on.  Also my [XScreenSaver][xshack] stopped working in the latest
  [void][void] update.
  - **PROS**
    - Full feature yet light on resources
    - Classic User Experience (great since I am very old computer user).
    - Was possible to use [XScreenSaver][xshack].
- [standard gnome][gnome]: This is supposed to be the **Premier** Linux [Desktop Environment].
  Personally, I find it hard to use, as it completely deviates from User Experienced of
  [Microsoft Windows 95][win95].  WHile it may be innovative, for me, an old computer user,
  it just gets in the way of getting things done.  So for me it is a total turn-off.
  Also, under [void][void] I was only able to use the [Wayland][wayland] session.
  - **PROS**
    - Very modern and popular desktop
  - **CONS**
    - Too modern for my taste
    - Could only run on [wayland][wayland].
- [gnome flashback][flashback] : This returns the [gnome][gnome] desktop back to a _classic_
  user experience.  I personally find this UX much better than the [standard gnome][gnome] user
  experience.  Visually, was very smooth and appealing.  I found it quite pleasant.  I was also
  able to run it as part of the X session.
  - **PROS**
    - Buttery smooth look and feel
- [KDE plasma][plasma] : This is the [KDE project][plasma] [Desktop Environment][de].  I found
  it OK, but not particularly special.  I just tried it on [void][void] and managed it to get it
  to work and do stuff, but didn't feel worth it to stick around too much.
- [XFCE4][xfce]: This is another classic UX [Desktop Environment][de].  Just like [MATE][mate]
  is a full featured desktop that tends to be light on resources.  I find it stable and a
  good performer.  The main reason why I did not opt for [xfce][xfce] is that this is the desktop
  I usually use for Virtual Machines that I spin up on the cloud.  So it is useful to have a
  visually different UX so as not to get confused between working locally and working on a cloud
  system.
  - **PROS**:
    - Classic User Experience (great since I am very old computer user).
- [budgie][budgie]: Did not work for me on [void linux][void].  It would start, but the mouse
  and keyboard would be unresponsive.
- [cinnamon][cinnamon]: Did not work for me on [void linux][void].  It would start, but the mouse
  and keyboard would be unresponsive.
- [pantheon][pantheon]: This is a desktop that I would like to try, but it is
  not available on [Void Linux][void].

# Pet Peeves

## Wayland

The [Wayland][wayland] project started back in 2008.  It started as a modern Window
system implementation, slated to replace [Xorg][xorg].  I am writing this is 2023,
and after 15 years, it is only partially available.  As far as I can tell, the only
desktop environments that support [wayland][wayland] are [gnome][gnome] and
[plasma][plasma].

I think this is a pity, but that is how things are in Open Source without a real
corporate sponsor.

## GTK+ libraries

I find this is a bit of a mess.  I think it is ude with how the [gnome][gnome] project
is evolving it software components.  I use [void linux][void] and at the time of this
writing I can install from the [void][void] repositories three different versions of
[GTK+][gtk], v2, v3 and v4.  Also, I tried compiling a package called [Xnee][xnee] and
that actually seemed to require v1.

Anyways, because different programs require different [GTK+][gtk] release levels, this
means that my working [void][void] desktop has all three versions installed.

I personally find this quite messy.  Again, this is a fact of life with fully Open Source
Software.
