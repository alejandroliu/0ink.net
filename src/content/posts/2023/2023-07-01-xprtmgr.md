This is a small utility to manage a local printer(s) in
a home office setting.

It will show the state of the printer:

- accepting or rejecting jobs
- enable or disabled printing

And if `sudo` is configured correctly would allow users to:

- enable or disable printing
- accept or reject new print jobs
- print a test page
- Show device info.  It would try to start `hp-toolbox` if relevant.

It also let's you manage the local printer job queue.  Allowing you to:

- show what jobs are in the queue
- cancel a job
- cancel all job

It is not intended to replace the CUPS WebUI.  It is just a simple
gui to handle the most common cases for a home office allowing
end-users some simple control of printer management functions.

It makes use of:

- [pycups][pycups]
- [python tkinter][tkinter]
- [tkinter-tooltip][tooltip]
- [icons8][icons8]
