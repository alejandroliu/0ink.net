title: RDP vs VNC

For years I have been using [VNC][vnc] for my remote desktop needs.  This works
usually well enough.  The features that I like are:

- Basic set-up is easy
- Desktop sessions are persistent
- Can be used to view an actual X11.org desktop.
- Browser based clients via [noVNC][noVNC] or [Guacamole][guacamole]

On the other hand, a number of features are either not implemented or are
not easily implementable.

- On-demand desktop sessions.  Usually you can hack scripts to do this.  Or you
  can use `inetd` mode to create a session on-demand, however, this loses
  session persistence.
- While in theory, because most Desktops use [pulseaudio][pa] which would let you
  redirect audio to a remote, this is another protocol so it is not simple
  to set-up in practice.

So I have now found [xrdp][xrdp] which provides:

- Easy basic set-up
- On-demand desktop sessions (session management) with persistent session support.
- Sound redirection (however I have not been able to make this work)
- Browser based clients via [Guacamole][guacamole]


For the client side, you can either use:

- [RDP Client][mstsc] : which comes with MS-Windows or
- [freerdp][freerdp] : For Linux.

Still I have not been able to:

- Enable sound re-direction
  - [Configure sound](https://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=13655)
  - Essentially compile [module](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/pulseaudio-module-xrdp)
- Use to view an actuall X11.org desktop.  For this I am simply using [x11vnc][x11vnc]
  and just using the `vncviewer`.
