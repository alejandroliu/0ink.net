This is a sequel to my article [[../2021/2021-12-21-ipv6-blues.md|IPv6 blues]].

At the time it looked that only /64 prefix address was being allocated.
However, when I recently checked my ADSL modem router configuration I
noticed that actually the ADSL modem gets assigned /48 prefix.  Thids makes
the configuration *much* easier.

What is nice, is that for **"reasonable"** configurations, IPv6 usually does the
right thing and configures most things by itself.  For IPv6 routing, you only
need to enable the right functionality and most of the addressing is determined
automatically.
