Release new version (3.2.1) of [NacoWiki][nw].

The following changes are included:

- Added document properties
- Added `opts.yaml`
- API improvements
- Bug fixes and UI improvements
- Additional Plugins:
  - Versions
  - AutoTag
  - Albatros : Blog site generator (similar to [Pelican][pp]).

Most of the changes are to support the new plugins.

# Versions

Now, [NacoWiki][nw] keeps track of previous versions of articles.
This can be disabled on a per directory basis by creating an
`opts.yaml` and adding the `disable-props: true` entry.

# AutoTag

When an article is save it will create tags automatically based on
a `tagcloud.md` file containing a list of _tagging_ words.  This
is enabled only if there is a `tagcloud.md` file in the sub-directory
or any parent sub-directory.

# Albatros

This is a Blog site generator inspired by [Pelican][pp].  It was
mainly written to migrate this web site from [Pelican][pp] which
uses a Python based markdown implementation to the same markdown
implementation used in [NacoWiki][nw].  The reason being that
I use [NacoWiki][nw] to edit this Blog, so it makes sense to use
the same code to preview and generate the static web site.

It uses a slightly modified version of the template I was using
for this website, so the change should be transparent to most
peope.
