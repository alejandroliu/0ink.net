# Python development on Windows

For windows, you can use [WinPython][winpython].
I prefer to use this instead of the official distribution because:

1. It is a portable distro.
2. You can choose for a batteries included, or just the `dot` release
   which only contains Python and Pip.

This way I can have multiple versions available.  This is particularly
useful for me because of my [OTC][otc] development which uses
[OpenStack SDK][openstacksdk].  In my Windows system, I was only able
to make it work with Python v3.8.10 (due to some ancient dependancies).
Because I usually don't have a compiler, I can only use binary distros
and I am unable to find it for a newer Python version.

# Distributing Python scripts as single EXE or Directory

When distributing I had good results with [pyinstaller][pyinstaller].
You can create a single folder or a single exe distribution.  The
results work suprisingly well (if they work).  Some hints when using
[pyinstaller][pyinstaller]:

- Cross packaging is not possible.  If you need a Windows package
  you need to run it on Windows.
- Dependancies not always work correctly.  You may need to use
  these options:
  - `--hidden-import module`
  - `--collect-data module`
  - `--copy-metadata module`
  - `--collect-all package`
- In some cases, you may need to force the inclusion of non-python
  files.  Use:
  - `set sitedir=%WINPYDIR%\Lib\site-packages`
  - And in the command line:
  - `--add-data %sitedir%\path\to\data\file;path\to\data`
  - I use the `%sitedir%` variable to find things in the Python packages
    directory.
- It is best to create a batch file to issue the `pyinstaller` command.
- Because the command-line could become quite long, you can use the `^`
  escape.  Example:
  ```
  pyinstaller %buildtype% ^
    --hidden-import keystoneauth1 ^
    --collect-data keystoneauth1 ^
    --copy-metadata keystoneauth1 ^
    --hidden-import os_service_types ^
    --collect-data os_service_types ^
    --copy-metadata os_service_types ^
    --collect-all openstacksdk ^
    --copy-metadata openstacksdk ^
    --add-data %sitedir%\openstack\config\defaults.json;openstack\config ^
    --hidden-import keystoneauth1.loading._plugins ^
    --hidden-import keystoneauth1.loading._plugins.identity ^
    --hidden-import keystoneauth1.loading._plugins.identity.generic ^
  urotc.py
  ```

# Installing `netifaces` on Windows

NOTE: I tested this on Feb 2023.  See
[Original article here](https://allones.de/2018/11/05/python-netifaces-installation-microsoft-visual-c-14-0-is-required/)

`netifaces` is a [OpenStack SDK][openstacksdk] dependancy.  Under
version 3.8.10 I am able to install using `--only-binary=netifaces` option.

For newer versions it will fail with `Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required`
error message.

```
C:\RH>pip install netifaces
Collecting netifaces
  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/81/39/4e9a026265ba944ddf1fea176dbb29e0fe50c43717ba4fcf3646d099fe38/netifaces-0.10.7.tar.gz

        error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools": http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
```

Since the suggested URL doesn't work.  You need to do the following:

1. Go to the Microsoft-Repository
   [Tools for Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017)
   or use the direct link to
   [vs_buildtools.exe](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15).
   * ... it’s about 1.2MB
2. run „vs_buildtools.exe“
   * it downloads ~ 70 MB
3. Select `Workloads => Windows => [x] Visual C++ Build Tools“ => [Install]`
   * it downloads 1.12 GB
   * and installs
4. Re-boot (I don't know if it is required, but I did it just in case)

Now `netifaces` can get installed:

```
C:\RH>pip install netifaces
Collecting netifaces
  Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/81/39/4e9a026265ba944ddf1fea176dbb29e0fe50c43717ba4fcf3646d099fe38/netifaces-0.10.7.tar.gz
Installing collected packages: netifaces
  Running setup.py install for netifaces ... done
Successfully installed netifaces-0.10.7

# Documentation generation

When programming documentation is important, allthough very often
it takes a back seat.

To help keep it up to date, it is good to make it so it is easier to
maintain and update.  One way to do that is with keeping documentation
and code together, and automating the way documentation is generated.

There is a number of solutions to do this.  The one I looked at the most
were:

- [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/) :
  which is nice because it uses `markdown`, however, because it is
  essentially a static site generator, a lot of things needed to be done manually.
- [sphinx][sphinx] : At the end, [sphinx][sphinx] was the option that I liked
  the most.  It uses [RST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html)
  for markup which is different from `markdown`, but it is close enough.
  Also, [sphinx][sphinx] can also support `markdown` via some extensions
  but I did not try that.

## Using [sphinx][sphinx] for documentation

Prepare your environment:

```
pip install sphinx sphinx-argparse
```

In your project directory, I have two folders:

- `docs` : where the documentation source resides
- `src` : where the `python` code resides

Also, I ignore:

- `public` : where the generated documentation is created.  This can
  then be added into a CI pipeline to publish documentation.

Run:

```
sphinx-quickstart
```

In the `docs` folder, to initialize things.  This will create the files:

- `conf.py`
- `Makefile`
- `index.rst`

Modify `conf.py` to:

- include the source:
  ```python
  sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../src'))
  ```
- Customize project meta data
- Include enable desired extensions.  For max automation I enable:
  - sphinx.ext.autodoc
  - sphinx.ext.autosummary

Modify `Makefile` to run:

```
sphinx-apidoc -o apidoc ../src
```

This command extracts from `python` docstrings and creates the
relevant `rst` files.

For command line arguments, I use `arparse` extension.  Create a
`cli.rst` like so:

```
CLI
===

.. argparse::
   :filename: ../src/cli.py
   :func: cli_args
   :prog: cli.py
```

Where `cli.py` contains a function `cli_args` that returns an `ArgumentParser`
object.


### Example `docstring`

This is an example doc string to add to your code, after the element
declaration:

```python
   '''
   Summary text

   Description of the function

   :param str argname: argument passed
   :returns bool: Returns a boolean True on success, False on failure
   '''
```

No Need to make it too complicated.

# Passing Reserved Keywords as Keyword arguments

Very often when using _wrapped_ APIs, that used functions with
Keyword arguments that you would need to pass reserved
keywords (such as `class`, or `import`) as function keywords.

Of course, this is **NOT** allowed in python.  And you will get an error
like:

```
SyntaxError: Invalid syntax
```

To work around that, you need to place those keywords in a dictionary
and use `**` notation.  So instead of:

```python
response = client.service.SendSMS( toNum = '0666666666666',
                pass = '123456'}
           )
```

you would:

```python
response = client.service.SendSMS( toNum = '0666666666666',
                **{'pass': '123456'}
           )
```
