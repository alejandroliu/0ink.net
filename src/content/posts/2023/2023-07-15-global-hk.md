To make it easier to switch desktop environment I am using 
a Desktop Environment independant hot keys configuration using
[xbindkeys][xbindkeys].  This lets me use the same
keybindings on different Window managers and Desktop Environments.

This code can be found in [github][code].

Included are the follwoing:

- hk_helper : a bash or a tcl/tk implementations.  The latest
  version is based on tcl/tk.
- xbindkeysrc : hotkey configuration file
- xbindkeys.desktop : `/etc/xdg/startup` file.
- *obsolete* profile.sh : `/etc/X11/profiles.d` file (not used).

The script starts from `/etc/xdg/startup`, so as to make sure to 
let the desktop environment work and grab as many keys as possible.

Afterwards, if there is a `$HOME/.xbindkeysrc` it will start it first.
This is to allow home user keys to work.

Finally it will use the global `xbindkeysrc` file.

Defined hotkeys can be seen in the `xbindkeysrc` config file here:
