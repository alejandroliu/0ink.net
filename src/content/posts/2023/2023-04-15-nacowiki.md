A few months ago I extensibly modify [picowiki][pw] and creeated [NanoWiki][nw].

After using [NanoWiki][nw] for a few months, the code became somewhat of an
spaghetti mess.  This has to do that [picowiki][pw] was designed as a single
file, single class application with Plugin extension.  Since every change went
to a single class this quickly became difficult to manage.

Additionally, I realized that "NanoWiki" was not a very good name as this
name was used by several projects and organizations.

So, I went ahead and re-wrote the whole thing into [NacoWiki][nc].  These are
the changes:

- Cleaner and more functional UI.
- Initial REST-API support.
- Added a CLI interface.
- Off-tree installation, with the option of co-existing multiple instances.
- Code modularization,
  - `nacowiki` main class that integrates everything together.
  - `Core`: main WIKI functionality
  - `Cli`: CLI interface
  - `PluginCollection`: plugin support
- `CodeMirror` support now in the `Core` (instead of depending of Plugin implementations.
- Re-organized CSS files
- Raw/source code display.

As plugins:

- Page handlers:
  - HTML
  - Markdown
  - *NEW* source code
- *NEW* YouTube Links
- *NEW* Static site generator
- Emojis
- File includes
- Var snippets
- WikiLinks (*NEW*: search article names)

Features/improvements over [picowiki][pw]:

- file management: create, delete, rename, modify, attach, etc.
- hooks for access control
- meta data support
- Disabled code execution.  This can be considered a _"security"_ feature.
- Support for byte ranges.  This lets you stream video files directly
  from the wiki.
- toggable, folder or document views.
- theme support
- Multiple file type handling
