tags: application, feature, installation, markdown

This edition marks the migration of my Blog from
[Pelican][pp] to [NacoWiki][nw] Albatros.

This is a mostly transparent change.  I wrote Albatros specifically
to migrate this web site from [Pelican][pp] to a php based markdown
implementation.  As such, it uses a slightly modified version
of the [Pelican][pp] theme.

The main changes from the previous site are:

- Re-arranged file structure
- Built-in search functionality.  This no longer depends on duck-duck-go.
- Uses the same renderer as [NacoWiki][nw].
