To make it easier to switch desktop environment.

Use xbindkeys from Xsession with a /etc/X11/xbindkeysrc file.

- hk_helper : hotkey helper script
- profile.sh : copied to /etc/X11/profile.d.  Used by session setup
  script to launch xbindkeys
- xbindkeysrc : configuration file

It is kicked off by the X session script, but waits some time before
it calls xbindkeys.  This is to let the Desktop Environment register
its shortcuts first.

TODO: if $HOME/.xbindkeysrc exists, start again with that config file
