The other day, the 3D model I created back in [[../2016/2016-03-20-starting-with-3d-printing.md|2016]]
finally broke.

So, as such I created an updated model:

![top view]({static}/images/2025/3d-prints/soap-top-lr.jpg)
![bottom view]({static}/images/2025/3d-prints/soap-bot-lr.jpg)

For this I am using the same service from my [[../2024/2024-07-15-3d-printing.md|3D Printing updates]]
article.  So far they have been quite reliable.

This model took only two attempts to get to the working version.  The first attempt
was soooo stupid.  I created the model thinking in "centimeters", but uploaded
the model using "milimeters" as the unit.  Obviously, the results were tiny.

The new model, did not use any [support material][supports].  I achieve this by splitting
the model into two sections which later are glued together.  The top section and the bottom
section.

This also allows the two sections to be printed with different fill densities, which can
reduce the cost of the printing.

After I did the print, I tweaked the model, so that the bottom is 1mm smaller than the top.
Also the top uses less material.
I did not try printing the tweaked model, but I think it would have a nicer effect
than the original.

The models can be found here:

- Printed version in cm (scale by 10x when printing)
  - [Top part][v2-b]
  - [Bottom part][v2-a]
- Tweaked model (scale in mim now)
  - [Top part][v2.1-b]
  - [Bottom part][v2.1-a]
