# Introduction

This is an amusing weekend project.  I have an old [HP Stream 11 Pro G5][hpstream]
laptop that I wanted to repurpose.  It originally came pre-installed with Windows 10,
and I wanted to use it with Linux.  Since my Linux distro of choice is [voidlinux][void]
I downloaded the Live Image and wrote it to a USB drive.

![Laptop]({static}/images/2025/lnxboot/hpstream.png)

I plugged the USB drive into the laptop and turned in on.  I immeditely spammed the `Escape`
key to get the _boot menu_.  After selecting the USB drive as the boot device I booted
into Linux.  I was able to confirm that [voidlinux][void] was able to recognize most of the 
hardware in the laptop.

Normally I run my systems by booting from USB drive.  However for this laptop that would pose
a problem becase this laptop is very **basic** and only has **two** USB ports (which are USB2
to boot).

My standard configuration is boot from USB, and the data is in the internal drive.  If later
I want to change Operating Systems I only need to create a new USB drive and plug it in.

This approach with this [HP Stream 11 Pro G5][hpstream] is not good since as I mention
earlier, there are only **two** USB2 ports.   The laptop does have a Micro SD card
slot, so instead of creating a USB stick I could simply write to a Micro SD card.

![right side]({static}/images/2025/lnxboot/right.png)

So I wrote the live [voidlinux][void] image to a Micro SD card and try to boot from
it.  Unfortunately, the UEFI BIOS did not recognize the Micro SD card reader,
much less detect it as a bootable device.  So what I did is use [rEFInd][refind]
as a boot manager to be able to boot either Windows or Linux.  If Linux it
would boot into a _small_ Linux image.  This _small_ Linux image would then
load a Linux kernel and InitRAM image from the Micro SD card and boot from it.

This makes it possible to boot SD card images just like I do with USB sticks.

# Backing up

Since I really don't use MS-Windows much, I decided to remove the Windows system
from laptop.  However, since I am sure in the future I would want to send this
laptop for re-purposing, I would first need to backup the internal MMC contents.

The internal drive is only 64GB, with compression, it can be backed-up to a 32GB
USB stick.  For this I am using [clonezilla][cz] Live.  Since this laptop
has UEFI boot, preparing a suitable media is very easy.

![clonezilla logo]({static}/images/2025/lnxboot/clonezilla_logo.png)


1. Start with an empty USB stick.
2. Create two partitions:
   - 1GB VFAT partition : for [clonezilla][cz] software
   - remaining space as an `xfs` or `ext4` partition to store the backup images
3. Create the filesystems on the first and second partitions.
4. Download [clonezilla][cz] Live.  I am using the **stable** Debian based
   version.  If you have more exotic hardware you may need to use the 
   Ubuntu based version.
5. Unzip the contents of [clonezilla][cz] Live to the first partition of
   USB drive.
   
With this you have suitable media to perform the backup.  As before
plug the USB stick to the laptop, spam the `Escape` key until you 
can get the boot menu and select to boot from the USB stick.

1. From the GRUB menu, select Clonezilla Live.  Since I am old,
   I selected the `VGA with Large Font` option.  Becaue this loads
   everything to RAM, this would take a bit longer than usual.
2. After configuring the region and keyboard type, select `Start Clonezilla`.
3. Choose `device-image` mode and select `local_dev` in the next menu. \
   Breeze through the next couple of screens as the target drive is already
   inserted.
4. For the `/home/partimag` repository select the second (large) partition
   on the USB stick. \
   The next skip asks for `fsck`.  Just do `no-fsck` since it is a new
   partition. \
   Then select the root folder of the partition when prompted.
5. Select `Beginner` when asked for the __Wizard mode__ to use.
6. Select `savedisk` to backup the whole MMC drive, and give a suitable name
   to the image set.
7. Select the drive to backup.  In my laptop, it is shown as `mmcblk1`. \
   For compression option I chose `z9p` for max compression. \
   The next options are just for error checking.  Pick what you think its
   best.

That starts the backup process.  After some time the backup process
will finnish.  You can put away the USB drive in a safe place.  You
will need it to reset the laptop for re-use.

For this step there a several options.  I chose [clonezilla][cz] because
was the simplest and most straightforward.  Personally, I do not like
the user experience of the Live USB, but it works.

Underneath it uses [partimage](https://www.partimage.org/) which is no
longer an active project.  One could have used instead a standard live
distro and use [fsarchiver](https://www.fsarchiver.org/) or 
[partclone](https://partclone.org/).  With this we have a simple
purpose build USB that contains the restore images in one single
package.

# Installing Refind

![refind logo]({static}/images/2025/lnxboot/refind-logo.png)

You can download [refind][refind] from its download page:

- https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html

The detailed installation instructions can be found here:

- https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#linux

For my case I used  the [voidlinux][void] live
USB I used before for testing.

1. Boot into [voidlinux][void] live USB.
2. Since we booted using the USB drive, the EFI partitions is usually
   not mounted.  To mount:
   ```bash
   mount -t vfat /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt
   ```
3. Download the binary zip file from [getting refind](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html)
4. Copy refind to the EFI partition:
   ```bash
   cp -av refind-bin-VERSION/refind /mnt/EFI/refind
   ```
5. Remove unneeded drivers and/or architectures:
   ```
   rm -r drivers_ia32 drivers_aa64
   ```
6. Rename the `refind.conf-sample` to `refind.conf` and edit it to taste. \
   For example, make sure that `showtools` line contains `bootorder` which
   I use in a later step.
7. Add [refind][refind] to the list of available boot loadders:
   ```bash
   efibootmgr -c -l \\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi -L rEFInd -d /dev/mmcblk1
   ```
8. Install additional components (See [addons](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#addons).
   Myself, I download the `shell.efi` file.   
9. Re-boot system and spam the `Escape` key while booting to get to the BIOS
   menu.  Select `rEFInd`.  Use the [refind][refind] utility to change the
   boot order to make sure that [refind][refind] is **before** the
   `Windows boot manager`.

Up to now, we are able to boot Linux from either the internal MMC or from a USB drive.
In order to boot from the MicroSD card slot we need to create a custom Linux
image that can be used to select and load a kernel from the MicroSD card.  For that
we use [buildroot][br2].

The purpose of [refind][refind] here is to easily support dual-booting Linux and
Windows.  It is unfortunate that the EFI run-time does not seem to support the MicroSD
card reader.  If that was the case we could stop now.

There are multiple alternatives to [refind][refind] such as [GNU Grub2](https://partclone.org/).
I find grub very Linux oriented and I find the configuration system overly complicated.

# Custom Linux

[Buildroot][br2] is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of building a complete Linux
system for an embedded system, using cross-compilation.

In order to achieve this, [Buildroot][br2] is able to generate a cross-compilation toolchain, a
root filesystem, a Linux kernel image and a bootloader for your target. [Buildroot][br2] can be used
for any combination of these options, independently (you can for example use an existing
cross-compilation toolchain, and build only your root filesystem with [Buildroot][br2]).

![br2 logo]({static}/images/2025/lnxboot/br2.png)


For our use-case we need:

- Linux kernel with `kexec` function call enabled and a number of drivers built-in
- `kexec` utilities/userspace
- Some basic user space utilties (mostly provided by `busybox`)
- `dialog` utiltiy for user displays

With [buildroot][br2] we can create a Linux kernel with the necessary drivers and
a initrd image with enough utilities to read the MicroSD card reader, give the
option to pick a kernel and boot into it.

## voidlinux pre-requisites

As one of the steps in [buildroot][br2] it will build its own `fakeroot`
command.  This does not work in [voidlinux][void] with musl runtime.  You
must either switch to [voidlinux][void] with glibc or follow my recipe
in [[../2019/2019-04-10-void-musl-with-glibc.md|Mixing glibc with musl]].

Preparing a [voidlinux][void] system with musl runtime:

```bash
sudo env XBPS_ARCH=x86_64 xbps-install \
		--repository=https://repo-default.voidlinux.org/current  \
        -r /glibc -S \
        base-voidstrap
```

You must also install the following package build dependancies:

```text
base-devel ncurses-devel rsync wget cpio
```


## Setting up Buildroot 

[buildroot][br2] is distributed via a git repository.  From this
repository you can select the version that you want to use.

Fetch [buildroot][br2]:

```bash
git clone  https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot
cd buildroot
git co -b dev 2024.02.9
```

I have only tested version `2024.02.9`.  The [buildroot][br2] project has a __LTS__
schema where the `YYYY.02` releases are considered for long term support/more stable.


I am using out-of-tree builds and also customizations are kept separte from [buildroot][br2]
using the [BR2_EXTERNAL](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#outside-br-custom)
functionality.

This keeps things nice and tidy.

The [buildroot][br2] customizatins are in separate [github][lb] repository.  To use
it you need to fetch it with git.

Fech [lnxboot][lb] repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TortugaLabs/lnxboot.git

```

For the out-of-tree build, you just need to create an empty directory and 
and set-things up.

Create a folder for out-of-tree building:

```bash
mkdir build_dir
cd build_dir
glibc make O=$(pwd) BR2_EXTERNAL=$(readlink -f ../lnxboot) -C ../buildroot lnxboot_defconfig

glibc make
```
- The first `make` sets up the out-of-tree build environment.  We use `defconfig`
  target so that the `savedefconfig` function works correctly.
- The second `make` applies the configuration settings for 



You will find in `images` of `build_dir` two files:

- bzImage
- rootfs.cpio.gz

Copy this to the EFI partition and update `refind.conf` to boot it.

From the build directory you can customize things with this commands:

- `glibc make menuconfig` - Configures [buildroot][br2]
- `glibc make linux-menuconfig` - Configures the Linux kernel
- `glibc make busybox-menuconfig` - Configures busybox

Additional make targets:

- `glibc make img` - Create a qemu bootable image (for testing)
- `glibc make run-qemu` - Create a qemu bootable image and boot it (for testing)
- `glibc make lnxboot-update` - Updates the lnxboot configuration files.
