# Letsencrypt

For home users there is not much use for running you own 
Certificate Authority (CA), and with availability of
[Letsencrypt][le] and the plethora of ACME libraries
setting TLS encryption is quite straight forward.

There are also some alternatives to [Letsencrypt][le] that
offer free certificates:

- [Buypass](https://www.buypass.com)
- [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com)
- [SSL.com](http://www.ssl.com/)
- [Google Trust Services](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/automate-public-certificate-lifecycle-management-via--acme-client-api)

These are commercial offerings that have a free tier.

I myself use [letsencrypt][le] with [acme.sh][as] because it is
available for Alpine Linux, which is my preferred Operating System
for my home servers.

# Private Certificate Authority

There are some scenarios that it would be useful to run your own
Certificate Authority (CA).  For example:

- When you require a lot of certificates.
- Authenticate users or client devices.

There are some tools that take care of most of the details
on how to run your own CA.


Still, this may be useful to know in case you ever need to.  I
tried the folowing myself:

- [caman][caman] \
  Written in shell script, and support intermediate certificates.
- [minica][minica] \
  Written in go language.  Very simple and straightforward.
- [mkcert][mc] \
  Another one in go language.  A simple zero-config tool to make
  locally trusted development certificates with any names you'd like.

# Creating your own CA

## Display cert extensions
## view cert info
## checking server cert
