I wrote a simple C language plugin for [Geany][ge].  It is similar to geany's standard
[keyrecord][gk] plugin which simply records and playbacks key sequences.  However unlike
[keyrecord][gk] which uses `key events`, it uses the [Scintilla][sci] macro recording
functionality like [geanymacros][gm] plugin.  However, unlike [geanymacros][gm] does
not do macro editing, and binding macros to multiple keys.

My plugin can be found in this Github [repo][gh].  Most of the boiler plate I 
got it from another plugin, [Ctrl-Alt][ca].

# Pre-requisites

I use [void-linux][void], so in [void][void] you first need to install the pre-requisites.
This can be done with the command:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -S base-devel geany-devel
```

# Registering

Firs you need to include `<geanyplugin.h>` which brings all the [Geany][geany] API as well as
the necessary GTK headers.

```c
#include <geanyplugin.h>

```

and export a function named `geany_load_module()`.
This function is used to tell [Geany][ge] of your plugin.  This includes metadata
such as name, description, version, etc.  But also includes pointers to function such as:

- `init` - plugin initialization
- `cleanup` - finalization
- `configure` - optional configuration function
- `help` - optional help functionality
- `callbacks` - optional array of `PluginCallback` functions

# Building

To compile a plugin:

```bash
gcc -c plugin.c -fPIC `pkg-config --cflags geany` 
```

Linking the plugin:

```bash
gcc plugin.o -o plugin.so -shared `pkg-config --libs geany` 
```

If all went OK, put the library into one of the paths Geany looks for plugins, e.g.
`$prefix/lib/geany` or `$HOME/.config/geany/plugins`.

# Binding keys

Previous versions of the [Geany][ge] API a plugin would register bindings itself.
Currently, a plugin defines a binding as a _group_name_ and _key_name_ and
the user can configure the actual key combination.

To define the key bindings you must add to the init function:

```c
key_group = plugin_set_key_group(plugin, PLUGIN_KEY_NAME, KB_COUNT, NULL);
keybindings_set_item(key_group, KB_RECORD, macrec_record, 0, 0,
			"record", "Start/Stop recording macro", NULL);
keybindings_set_item(key_group, KB_PLAY, macrec_play, 0, 0,
			"playback", "Playback macro", NULL);

```

Where:

- `PLUGIN_KEY_NAME` is a string for naming the key group.
- `KB_COUNT` is the number of keys in the key group.  This is defined
  using an _C_ `enum`.  `KB_RECORD` and `KB_PLAY` are in the same `enum`
  and are unique numbers identifying a key combination.
- `macrec_record` and `macrec_play` are the callback functions executed
  when the given keybinding is pressed.

# Callbacks

Callbacks are functions called whenever a [Geany][ge] event is fired.  These
are defined in `geany_load_module` function as:

```c
plugin->funcs->callbacks = macrec_callbacks;
```

`macrec_callbacks` is defined as:

```c
static PluginCallback macrec_callbacks[] =
{
        { "editor-notify", (GCallback) &on_editor_notify, FALSE, NULL },
        { "document-close", (GCallback) &on_document_close, FALSE, NULL },
        { NULL, NULL, FALSE, NULL }
};

```

We are hooking to events, `editor-notify` which is used for recording macros
and uses the [Scintilla][sci] built-in recording facility.

`document-close` is used to abort recording of macros.

# Convenience functions

For this plugin I am using a few convenience functions:

- [ui_set_statusbar][ui_set_statusbar] - Display text on the status bar.
- [msgwin_status_add][msgwin_status_add] - Logs a formatted status message _without_
  setting the status bar.
- [utils_open_browser][utils_open_browser] - Tries to open the given URI in a browser.

# Recording

For macro recording we using [Scintilla][sci] functionality.  This is in
contrast to the [keyrecord][gk] plugin which uses low-level GTK functionality
which for me is not vedry reliable.

Start recording:

```c
scintilla_send_message(document_get_current()->editor->sci,SCI_STARTRECORD,0,0);
```

After that, we capture events using `editor-notify` callback.  In that function
we use a table to classify and identify the messages we want to handle:

```c
/* structure to hold details of Macro for macro editor */
typedef struct {
  gint message;
  const gchar *description;
} MacroDetailEntry;

/* list of editor messages this plugin can handle & a description */
const MacroDetailEntry MacroDetails[]={
{SCI_CUT,N_("Cut to Clipboard")},
{SCI_COPY,N_("Copy to Clipboard")},
{SCI_PASTE,N_("Paste from Clipboard")},
{SCI_LINECUT,N_("Cut current line to Clipboard")},
{SCI_LINECOPY,N_("Copy current line to Clipboard")},
```
**... content deleted ...**

```c
{0,NULL}
};

```

Once recording we stop [Scintilla][sci] macro recording.

```c
scintilla_send_message(document_get_current()->editor->sci,SCI_STOPRECORD,0,0);
```

# Playback

Since the recording is done using [Scintilla][sci] facilities we
have to use [Scintilla][sci] playback.  This is realized with this
function call:

```c
scintilla_send_message(sci,me->message,me->wparam,(sptr_t)clipboardcontents);

```

To make sure that the undo history is consistent, we call:

```c
scintilla_send_message(sci,SCI_BEGINUNDOACTION,0,0);
```

before playback, and call:

```c
scintilla_send_message(sci,SCI_ENDUNDOACTION,0,0);
```

to finish the __UNDO__ action.

# Finishing touches

I also added a github action to the [repository][gh] to compile the
code (to ensure that things at least compile).

![gh actions logo]({static}/images/2025/gh-actions.png)

For that I am using a simple C/C++ workflow.  What I added was the 
task to make sure that the correct dependancies are available:

```yaml
- name: Install dependancies
  run: sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev autoconf automake autopoint gettext geany

```
