So since last year I have been using [utterances][u] to add comments to my BLOG.  After
reading [this post][u2g] from [Max Brenner][mb], I decided to switch to [giscus][g].

[Giscus][gs] is a comments system powered by [GitHub Discussions][gd]. It lets visitors leave
comments and reactions on your website via GitHub!

I agree with the comments from [Mr. Brenner][mb]:

- Post reactions \
  While [utterances][u] allows to add reactions to comments, [giscus][g] also adds reactions
  to the post itself.
- Lack of maintenance \
  Apparently, [utterances][u] hasn't been updated in three years and has a long issue list
  which is not really being worked upon.
