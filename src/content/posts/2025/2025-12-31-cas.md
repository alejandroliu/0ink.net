- Read about OpenSSL and certificates.
  - Tested Cerfiticate Authorities \
    The following are CLI CA's.  There are other Server based implementtions,
    with API's.
    - ~~https://github.com/lipixun/pyca (Python)~~
      - Should be hackable
      - Uses openssl commands
      - Does not support intermediate certs
      - Error handling is terrible
      - Python2 (2to3 works partially)
    - https://github.com/radiac/caman (Shell)
      - Supports intermediate certs
    - ~~https://github.com/jsha/minica (Go Lang)~~
  - Because we want to also encode permissions in the certificates, maybe we
    need to do our own thing.

      extensions handling.

```bash
 openssl req -new -subj "/C=GB/CN=foo" \
                  -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:foo.co.uk" \
                  -addext "certificatePolicies = 1.2.3.4" \
                  -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem
```

After giving it some thought, it is bad idea to store "permissions" in the certificate.
This is because, you can't change permissions on a certificate after it has been
issued.  You will need to re-issue the certificate.

Maybe, it would be better, to only store the identity, and use a permissions file either
statically or on a server, to figure out if they are authorized to perform that action.

That way, if you need to change permissions, you change the static file, or better,
you change a permissions (authorization) server.
