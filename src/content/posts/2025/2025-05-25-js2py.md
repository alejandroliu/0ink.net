[Js2Py][jp] translates JavaScript to Python code. [Js2Py][jp] is able to translate and execute
virtually any JavaScript code.

[Js2Py][jp] is written in pure python and does not have any dependencies. Basically an implementation
of JavaScript core in pure python.

While intriguing, I do not see the point to do this.  Going from Python to JavaScript seems
to be more useful.

The **only** use case I would have for this is to parse those [Proxy Auto Configuration][pac]
scripts or PAC files.

Speaking of Python to JavaScript translators, Google search of `py2js` has multiple hits.  The
one that seems more supported and included in the PyPi repository is [am230/py2js][pj].  Then
again, you are better off using [[2025-05-06-brython.md|Brython]].
