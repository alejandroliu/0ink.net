[Brython][br] (Browser Python) is an implementation of Python 3 running in the browser,
with an interface to the DOM elements and events.

In a way it is similar to [pyjs][pj], however, looks like development has stalled.

[Brython][br] is designed to replace Javascript as the scripting language for the Web. As
such, it is a Python 3 implementation (you can take it for a test drive through a web console),
adapted to the HTML5 environment, that is to say with an interface to the DOM objects and events.

The demos seem to be impressive enough.

[Brython][br] development is hosted in [github][gh].

[Brython][br] supports the syntax of Python 3, and the modules of the CPython distribution
written in Python, except for the features that are not relevant in the browser context
(writing on disk for instance).

It includes libraries to interact with DOM elements and events, and with existing Javascript
libraries such as jQuery, D3, Highcharts, Raphael etc. It supports the latest specs of
HTML5/CSS3, and can use CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap3, LESS, SASS etc.

A tutorial can be found in [Brython: Python in Your Browser][tutorial].

While interesting, I think it is better to learn TypeScrint and JavaScript directlly as
these are more marketable as Front End devlopment languages.
