# Introduction


I've been using [Docker][docker] for a few years, and recently decided to
switch to [Podman][podman] for a new server I'm building. I was pleasantly
surprised by how quick and easy the transition was.

# What is Podman?

[Podman][podman] is an alternative to [Docker Desktop][docker].  
[Podman][podman] is an open source container management tool designed to provide
a daemonless and rootless approach to running containers, setting it apart from
traditional container platforms like [Docker][docker]. It allows users to manage
containers, pods, and images using a command-line interface similar to Docker's,
making it accessible for those familiar with [Docker][docker] commands. [Podman][podman]
is particularly focused on security, enabling containers to run without requiring
root privileges, which helps minimize potential vulnerabilities. It integrates
seamlessly with tools like Kubernetes, supporting native pod management. Developed
as part of the Red Hat ecosystem, [Podman][podman] is a versatile choice for users
seeking a secure, lightweight, and flexible alternative for container management.

[Podman][podman] bills itself
as an open source alternative to [Docker][docker], despite [Docker][docker]
also being open source. 
Docker Inc., the company behind Docker, has a business model that includes offering
commercial products and services around its open source technology.

[Podman] is an alternative to [Docker Desktop][docker]. It's an open-source
container management tool that offers a daemonless and rootless approach to
running containers, differentiating it from traditional platforms like
[Docker][docker]. Podman allows users to manage containers, pods, and images
using a command-line interface similar to [Docker][docker], making it
user-friendly for those familiar with [Docker][docker] commands. It emphasizes
security by enabling containers to run without root privileges, reducing
potential vulnerabilities. [Podman][podman] integrates well with Kubernetes,
supporting native pod management, and is developed as part of the Red Hat
ecosystem. It's a versatile option for users looking for a secure, lightweight,
and flexible alternative for container management.

While [Podman][podman] promotes itself as an open-source alternative to
[Docker][docker], it's worth noting that Docker is also open source. Docker
Inc. offers commercial products and services around its open-source technology.

# Installation on Alpine Linux

Since my preferred server's operating system is [Alpine Linux][alpine], I
installed [Podman][podman] on a test [Alpine Linux][alpine] virtual machine.

First, enable the [Alpine Linux][alpine] community repository by modifying the
`/etc/apk/repositories` file and uncommenting the following line:

```text
http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/vX.YY/community
```

Then, install [Podman][podman] with the following command:

```bash
apk add podman
```

To enable Podman at startup, use:

```bash
rc-update add podman
```

This is all that's needed to run Podman in rootful mode.


## Rootful vs Rootless

[Podman][podman] supports two modes of operation: rootful and rootless. In
rootful mode, the container runs as root on the Linux host (or VM on
Mac/Windows), while in rootless mode, it runs under a standard Unix user
account. Rootless mode offers stronger security, but some containers may not
work under the increased restrictions. For example, containers that create new
devices or perform restricted operations must run as root. This is different from
the _USER_ value in Containerfile/Dockerfile, which affects how processes inside
the container perceive themselves. In rootless mode, processes that appear as root
inside the container are actually running as a restricted user on the host system.

Since I'm migrating from [Docker][docker], I've decided to keep everything in
rootful mode.

The [Alpine Linux wiki][awp] provides steps for installing [Podman][podman] in
rootless mode. Note that the instructions for running as `root` are slightly outdated.

## Configuring Podman

I usually run my servers in [diskless][dl] and/or [data disk][dd] modes. Because
[Podman][podman] expects some data to be persistent, I modify the configuration
to store persistent data elsewhere:

Ensure [Podman][podman] is **not** running:

```bash
service podman stop
```

Edit `/etc/containers/storage.conf`, find the `[storage]` section, 
and modify the `graphroot` key to point to your persistent storage location:

```text
graphroot = "/media/data/containers/podman"
```

Make sure that the `graphroot` directory exists:

```bash
mkdir -p /media/data/containers/podman
```

If you stopped [Podman][podman] earlier, you can start it now:

```bash
service podman start
```

# Compatibility with Docker


For composer compatibility you can use [Podman Compose][pc] or
[docker compose][dc] itself (with the previously mentioned
[socket API][api] compatibility).  I myself chose to use
[docker compose][dc] instead of [Podman Compose][pc] becase
[Podman Compose][pc] depends on Python (and I wanted to keep
my install leaner).

To enable this you need to install [docker compose][dc]:

[Podman][podman] includes a socket [API][api] that's drop-in compatible with
[Docker][docker] tools, allowing you to use the [Docker][docker] CLI,
[docker-compose][dc], and even [Portainer][portos].

For compatibility with compose tools, you can use [Podman Compose][pc] or
[docker-compose][dc] itself, thanks to the socket [API][api] compatibility.
I've chosen to use [docker-compose][dc] instead of [Podman Compose][pc]
because the latter depends on Python, and I wanted to keep my installation
leaner.

To enable this, install [docker-compose][dc]:

```bash
apk add docker-cli-compose
```

For convenience, create a small script at `/usr/local/bin/podman-compose`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Set DOCKER_HOST pass -H to override
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/podman/podman.sock
exec docker-compose "$@"
```

Using the socket [API][api], you can manage [Podman][podman] with [Docker][docker]
commands via the `-H` option or the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable. For more
information, see the [Docker manual][sockopt]. On the [Podman][podman]
host, you can use:

- `-H unix:///run/podman/podman.sock` or
- `export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/podman/podman.sock`

Interestingly, you can control a remote [Podman] instance using this method. For
example, you can use the [Docker CLI][docker] on your development PC to control
the [Podman][podman] instance on your server:

- `-H ssh://root@remote-server:22/run/podman/podman.sock`
- `export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://root@remote-server/run/podman/podman.sock`

## Moving of --link'ed containers

Old containers using [Container Links][lcl] can not be moved directly to
[Podman][podman] without changes.  The [Container Links][lcl] feature is
now obsolete and [Docker][docker] supports it only for compatibility.

![links]({static}/images/2025/podman/container-links.png)

In [Podman][podman] you are better off creating a new network using:

```bash
podman create network NETWORK_NAME
```

Connect your containers to that network:

```bash
podman run -d \
    -p 8080:80 \
    --restart=always \
    --network=NETWORK_NAME \
    nginx:latest
```

Then you can use the container name using the DNS resolver.  Note that the default
[Podman][podman] network has this internal DNS resolver disabled and you need
to create a new one.

If you are using `docker compose` a network is created by default and all the
containers in the stack will be connected to it.
