title: My tale of IPv6 whoes

My ISP provider is [KPN][kpn].  They recently enabled
IPv6 in my street.  I was using before a IPv6 Tunnel Broker,
starting with [SixXS][sixxs] and after they went out,
with [Hurricane Electric][he].  So naturally,
I decided to switch to KPN's native IPv6 service.

They provide a /64 prefix, which is reasonable.  Would be better
if they provided a /48, but /64 is better than other providers.

So to start using KPN as the IPv6 turned out very easy.  Their default
configuration works right out of the box if you have single flat
network.

I used to have a router/FW between the KPN modem and my network,
but at some point I decided to go for a flat network design.  With
this, (without having to do anything) once KPN enabled IPv6, all my
equipment that was IPv6 capable started using IPv6.  It was like
magic.

I run a number of server systems in my home network, using
[Alpine Linux][alpine] as its operating system.

For some reason, these servers would be able to use IPv6 at first
(either via static configuration or auto-configuration), but stop
working after a few minutes (often after 65 seconds).

Things worked fine for my [void-linux][void] systems.  These
use [NetworkManager][netman] so I guess this helps.

Even googling around I was not able to find a solution.  Apparently
doing this would re-enable things:

```
ip -6 a del $ip6_addr dev $IFACE
ip -6 a add $ip6_addr dev $IFACE
```

So what I did is, I wrote a small little script that would run
every 45 seconds, and do this:

```
ip -6 address save dev $IFACE scope global > $savefile
ip -6 address flush dev $IFACE scope global
ip -6 address restore < $savefile 2>&1 | grep -v 'RTNETLINK answers: File exists' || :
```

Again, I have no idea what is going on.

Eventually I changed my set-up to have something like
this:

```
+---------+   +------+   +------------+
|KPN modem|---|router|---|HOME NETWORK|
+---------+   +------+   +------------+

```

The `router` in between does Network Address Translation
and Firewalling.  The reasons I chose this is:

- More _natural_ way of handling incoming connections
- Makes it possible to switch ISP's easier, down the line.
  Alternatively, would make it possible to load-balance between
  two ISPs.
- Can use `iptables` for firewally.  I recognize that this is
  only good for a geek like me though.

This causes problems with my IPv6 set-up because
now I have two segments.

The KPN modem, assumes a flat network (with /64).  Since
I can't create routes in the KPN modem then the only
option would have been to NAT.  However the general
concensus is **NOT** to NAT IPv6.  See
[this article](https://blogs.infoblox.com/ipv6-coe/ipv6-nat-you-can-get-it-but-you-may-not-need-or-want-it/)
for example.

An alternative would have been to split the /64 into /80
segments.  Unfortunately, that doesn't work as a lot of the
software out there assumes that the network part of the IPv6
address is at most 64 bits.

Linux has a feature built-in to the kernel called `proxy_ndp`.
For [example](https://vtluug.org/wiki/Proxy_NDP),

The problem is that this does not scale well as the proxy address
needs to be statically configured.

There are daemons that claim to proxy NDP for ranges:

- [ndppd](https://github.com/DanielAdolfsson/ndppd)
- [ndp-proxy](https://github.com/setaou/ndp-proxy)

These however did not work for me.

So I wrote my own script to manage kernel `proxy_ndp` entries
myself.  Essentially it does the following:

- listen on `ip monitor` for IPv6 neighbor messages
- add and remove kernel data

The whole script can be found [here](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/ipv6-whoes/ndpbr.sh).

Another approach is to use [dnsmasq][dnsmasq] and can
be found [here](https://quantum2.xyz/2019/03/08/ndp-proxy-route-ipv6-vpn-addresses/).
