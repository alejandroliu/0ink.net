Finally got fedup with [github pages][ghp] and its [jekyll][jk]
static site generator.  Essentially things would break without
any particular reason and there would be nearly no way to
tell what went wrong.  I addition, it was not easy to test
changes before making them public.

So I switched to [pelican][pk], essentially because it was
a static site generator that is part of the [void][void]
software repository.

I don't really like it that much as its documentation is not
very good.  But eventually I got it to work.

I was able to get one of their public templates to work and
tweaked to match my preferences.

I also was able to add:

- automatic tag generation
  - this is done before processing input files.  i.e. a script
    reads existing content and modifies files as needed with
    automatic tags.
- sitemap generator
  - this is done as post-processing stage.  A script reads
    generated html files and generates the sitemap accordingly.

The most useful feature I found is its that I can preview
changes before commiting them.
