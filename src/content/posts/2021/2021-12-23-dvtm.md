The other day I found [dvtm][dvtm].  Looking at it, it
looks very nice.  It appeals to me because I am particularly
fond of text user interfaces.

At the end I choose not to use it because:

- terminal support was less than 100% useful.
- At the end of the day using the mouse is just more convenient.
- It is not as ubiquitous as for example [screen][screen].  So it
  is easier to just use [screen][screen] that can be set-up much
  more easily.
- most of the time I am already on a window session, so there is
  not that many opportunities to use this.
