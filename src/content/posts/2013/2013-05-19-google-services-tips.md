Recipe for cleaning a google calendar.

1.  Sign in to Google Calendar
2.  Click on Calendar Settings (current version has this just above the list of personal calendars, under an arrow).
3.  Click on "Delete" of the main calendar.
4.  A confirmation dialog box appears telling you that that "This deletes all events on primary Calendar".
