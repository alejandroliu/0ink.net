This is a procedure I go through at the end of the year
to clean-up my Outlook Calendar.  Usually the Outlook
Calendar gets full of junk over time.  So this is something
worth doing on a regular basis.

Procedure for Outlook 2007
--------------------------

1.  Backup calendar folder
2.  Select default calendar
3.  Switch view to `Inactive Appointments (non-recurrent)`
4.  Delete appointments
5.  Switch view to `Inactive Appointments (recurrent)`
6.  Delete appointments

Procedures for Previous versions of Outlook
-------------------------------------------

This is my procedure for cleaning my Outlook calendar from old appointments and other assorted outdated stuff:

1.  Backup your calendar folder (just in case)
2.  Create a temporary Calendar folder
3.  Select your default Calendar
4.  Switch to `All Appointments` view:
    *   View -> Current View -> All Appointments
5.  Select all the appointments and **move** them to the temporary Calendar folder
6.  Select the temporary Calendar folder
7.  Switch to `Active Appointments` vew:
    *   View -> Current View -> Active Appointments
8.  Select all the visible appointments and **move** the m back to the default Calendar folder.
9.  You can now dispose of the temporary folder (or backed it up for reference.
