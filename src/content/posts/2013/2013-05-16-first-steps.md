So finally took the time to re-launch the `0ink` web site. This time used more off-the shelf software. So this site is just a another plain [wordpress powered](http://wordpress.org) site. Actually I have to thank my son for _introducing_ me to **wordpress.** What happened is that my son, who is only seven wanted to have his own  
web site. (Due to peer pressure, kids these days...) He has an Android tablet that he uses quite often. Since I knew that **wordpress** can be used to make decent looking web sites and there even was an Android app. Also knew that free \*\*wordpress\* hosting sites can easily be found... Make a story short, I set him up with a [http://wordpress.com/](http://wordpress.com/) account and he was live on the 'Net in a matter of minutes. His website can be found [here](http://sebitoliu.wordpress.com/). This first foray got me intrigued, so I tested it on another free hosting [site (here)](http://s12.pw/) and found it quite powerful so decided to use it for `0ink.net` which seriously needed to move to a new host. The old hosting service [110mb](http://www.110mb.com/) had been taken over by a **new management team** and the new free hosting service was not as appealing as before. Add in a little bit of bit-rot and that site quickly became an ugly mess. So now we are back again, and hopefully will be more maintainable.
