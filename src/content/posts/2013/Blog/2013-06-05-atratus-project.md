The other day I came across this [project](http://atratus.org/ "Atratus project"). Looks an interesting idea. It is a project that lets you run unmodified Linux binaries on Windows. It is more similar to WINE than to for example coLinux. While I conceptually I understand how it would work at a low level, I am curious how it works with dynamically link executables. This is something I would like to test out when I have time.
