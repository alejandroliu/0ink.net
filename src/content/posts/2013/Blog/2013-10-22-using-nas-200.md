title: Using a NAS200 as a Print server

Last weekend I had a small weekend project to move my All-In-One Printer/Scanner from my Xen host server to a spare NAS200 I had lying around. Since the NAS200 has a i486 compatible CPU, and I had been able to run a CentOS 5 distro before, I figure it would make a good server with low power consumption.

![nas200]({{ site.url }}/images/2013/linksys-nas200.jpg)

For that I updated my [NASCC firmware](http://nascc.sf.net) so that it would boot a USB key, and update my CentOS image creation [script](https://sourceforge.net/p/nascc/wiki/centos/). This worked well, I was able to boot CentOS without _that much_ effort altogether.

I myself have an [Epson Stylus CX5500](http://www.cnet.com.au/epson-stylus-cx5500-339283304.htm) which unfortunately only comes with [binary drivers](http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/?OSC=LX). This was not much of a problem since the NAS200 has a i486 compatible CPU. I find this is relatively unique among different NAS models.

Alas, the performance was quite disappointing. I should be used to the NAS200 underperforming. But really, this was truly sad. I did not bother to test the printing, but I did try scanning with it. Running `scanimage` to scan a single page was taking over 15 minutes before I hit `Ctrl+C`.

It was an idea, but the results were so sub par. The only take-aways of this are:

*   I was able to run open source as well as binary blobs on a NAS200 relatively easily.
*   I was able to use CentOS5 pretty much out-of-the box. No recompiles required. Did notice though that `cups` would seg-fault. My guess is that the i386 package some how got some i686 optimizations on it.
*   My [Linux Ethernet Console](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nascc/files/LEC/) made a very good network console. I was able to troubleshoot some very early boot problems with it.
*   NAS200 performance for scanning was abysmal.
