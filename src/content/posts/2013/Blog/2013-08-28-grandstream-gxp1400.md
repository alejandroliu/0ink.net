[Grandstream GXP1400](http://www.grandstream.com/products/ip-voice-telephony/enterprise-ip-phones/product/gxp1400/1405)

The other day I replaced an analog phone with a Grandstream GXP1400 IP phone. I think it is a great value phone. It is one of the cheapest I could find yet supports all the features I was looking.

Specifically I wanted a IP phone that could:

1.  Have a remote phone directory
2.  Speaker phone

Setting it up was simple. Creating an account on Asterisk and providing the details for it to the phone. Creating a phone directory was also quite simple. I wrote a small PHP script to manage that.
