Recently I found this Open Source project. Apparently it recently
gained support to unpack **Exchange Offline Address Book** files. What
I don't know is after you unpack it, how would you use such a file.
Intriguing but apparently falls a little bit short. Probably would need
to try it out for myself to see how it works.
