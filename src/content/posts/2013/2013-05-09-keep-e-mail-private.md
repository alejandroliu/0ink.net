This is a handy tip.

If you don't want to give out your real email address to register for
a site and don't want to go through the hassle of creating a spam
email address, just point your browser to
[Guerrilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/)
upon loading the page you'll have an automatically assigned email
address that is good for one hour.

Hopefully this helps reduce spam.
