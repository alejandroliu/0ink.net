Some bash one-liners:

```
echo ${!X*}

```

Will print all the names of variables whos name starts with `X`. To
output the contents of a variable so it can be parsed by  
bash

```
declare -p VARNAME

```

# Pattern Matching

```
Operator: ${foo#t*is}

```

Function: deletes the shortest possible match from the left

```
Operator: ${foo##t*is}

```

Function: deletes the longest possible match from the left

```
Operator: ${foo%t*st}

```

Function: deletes the shortest possible match from the right

```
Operator: ${foo%%t*st}

```

Function: deletes the longest possible match from the right MNEMONIC:
The # key is on the left side of the $ key and operates from the left.
The % key is on the right of the $ key and operates from the right.

# Substitution

```
Operator: ${foo:-bar}

```

Function: If $foo exists and is not null, return $foo. If it doesn't
exist or is null, return bar.

```
Operator: ${foo:=bar}

```

Function: If $foo exists and is not null, return $foo. If it doesn't
exist or is null, set $foo to bar and return bar.

```
Operator: ${foo:+bar}

```

Function: If $foo exists and is not null, return bar. If it doesn't
exist or is null, return a null.

```
Operator: ${foo:?"error message"}

```

Function: If $foo exists and isn't null, return its value. If it
doesn't exist or is null, print the error message. If no error message
is given, it prints parameter null or not set. In a non-interactive
shell, this aborts the current script. In an interactive shell, this
simply prints the error message.

# $$ for Subshell

When running a sub-shell in `bash` the `$$` construct still returns
the process id of the main shell. Use the following construct to
determine the correct IP address:

```
mypid=$(sh -c 'echo $$PPID')

```

Yes, it looks _nasty_.

# Retrieving an IP address.

*Updated 2023-10-20*

To get the IP address, the easiest way is to use:

```bash
ip -br a
```

Results in:

```
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128 
enp1s0           DOWN           
eno1             UP             192.168.101.64/24 fd42:bf4e:715f:6ef5:95b0:ecc9:68fa:ac07/64 fe80::82db:4389:522c:332d/64 
wlp3s0           DOWN           
virbr0           DOWN           192.168.122.1/24 
docker0          UP             172.17.0.1/16 fe80::42:95ff:fe8e:29b0/64 
br-6f79780fe7d1  DOWN           172.18.0.1/16 
veth8758d36@if8  UP             fe80::a84f:c3ff:fe8f:45b/64 
```

Which is easy to parse.  Another option is:

```bash
ip -o a
```

Results:

```text
1: lo    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
1: lo    inet6 ::1/128 scope host proto kernel_lo \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eno1    inet 192.168.101.64/24 brd 192.168.101.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eno1\       valid_lft 26700sec preferred_lft 26700sec

6: docker0    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0\       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
6: docker0    inet6 fe80::42:95ff:fe8e:29b0/64 scope link proto kernel_ll \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
7: br-6f79780fe7d1    inet 172.18.0.1/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global br-6f79780fe7d1\       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
9: veth8758d36    inet6 fe80::a84f:c3ff:fe8f:45b/64 scope link proto kernel_ll \       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Has more information, but it is still fairly parsable.

# Identifying virtual Network Interfaces

If you need to identify which network interfaces are virtua, use:

```bash
readlink /sys/class/net/virbr0
```

Results in:

```text
../../devices/virtual/net/virbr0
```

The output contains `/virtual/` in the path.  Physical NICs would have something related to the bus
that the NIC is connected to.
