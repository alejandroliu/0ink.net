Assist is my [archlinux](http://www.archlinux.org/) scripted installation script.

*   [https://github.com/alejandroliu/assist](https://github.com/alejandroliu/assist)

By default it gives you a menu driven [archlinux](http://www.archlinux.org/) installation with supposedly _sensible_ defaults.

It has command line hooks so that you can perform automated installs using bash scripts to customize it.

It can be deployed from the CDROM by downloading and executing Assist directly from the Internet or by injecting it into the init ramdisk for deployment either from PXE or a custom boot CDROM.
