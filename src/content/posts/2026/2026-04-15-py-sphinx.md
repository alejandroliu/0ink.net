I have started using [sphinx][sphinx] for documention generation.

I do find [sphinx][sphinx] quite _prickly_
with the slightest mistake breaking things and error messages that are very 
*uninformative* or *confusing*.

Nevertheless, it is quite close to feature complete. 


# Introduction

[Sphinx][sphinx] is a documentation generator written and used by the
Python comunity.  It is written in Python, but it can be also used
to document projects written in other languages.

By default, it uses [reSturcutredText][rst] but it there are extension
to allow for [Markdown][myst] compatibility.

It can generate output in multiple formats.  Among others it supports:

* HTML (in different configurations)
* EPub
* Man pages

# Basic functionality

If you are using the default functionality you only really need the `sphinx`
Python package.

In this scenario, you must write all your documentation in [reStructuredText][rst]
and use [apidoc extension][apidoc].  Note, there is also an extension named
[autodoc][autodoc].  This is *NOT* the one you want, as it requires that you
manually write [reStructuredText][rst] files pointing to your source code.  The
[apidoc][apidoc] extension, makes use of the [autodoc][autodoc] extension and
creates any needed [reStructuredText][rst] files that may be needed.  The
limitation of [apidoc][apidoc] is that it is hard-coded to always generated
[reStructuredText][rst], so it can not be used for [Markdown][myst] documentation.

# Sample Usage

As mentioned earlier, [sphinx][sphinx] is quite _prickly_, so this is the configuration
I arrived at after a lot of trial and error.

[sphinx][sphinx] has a `sphinx-quickstart` command which is meant to set things up
for you.  I prefer to do this manually.

First of all, I assume that you have a project directory with a structure like this:

![pkgs]({static}/images/2026/sphinx/pkgs.png)


```text
your_package
│── your_package/                # Main package directory
│   ├── __init__.py              # Makes it a Python package
│   ├── module.py                # Your actual Python code
│── setup.py                      # Installation configuration
│── requirements.txt              # Optional: Dependencies list
│── README.md                     # Optional: Project info
```

To this I add a directory `docs` so the structure looks like:

```text
your_package
│── docs/                        # Sphinx documentation directory
│── your_package/                # Main package directory
│   ├── __init__.py              # Makes it a Python package
│   ├── module.py                # Your actual Python code
│── setup.py                      # Installation configuration
│── requirements.txt              # Optional: Dependencies list
│── README.md                     # Optional: Project info
```

For document generation we require the following Python packages:

- docutils : not really needed as it is a dependancy for sphinx
- sphinx : main documentation generator
- sphinx-autodoc2 : automatic documentation generation from source code
- myst-parser : [Markdown][myst] parser for [sphinx][sphinx]
- linkify-it-py : Dependancy for myst, adding convenient auto URL conversion.
- sphinx-argparse : Used  to document command line parsers

For convenience, I add this to my `docs/requirements.txt` file, since these
are dependancies for doc generation and not for the package itself.


In `docs`, I create the files: `Makefile`, `conf.py`, `index.md`, `make.bat`.

## docs/Makefile

<script src="https://tortugalabs.github.io/embed-like-gist/embed.js?style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on&fetchFromJsDelivr=on&target=https://github.com/TortugaLabs/mypielib/blob/main/docs/Makefile"></script>

## docs/make.bat

```text
@ECHO OFF

pushd %~dp0

REM Command file for Sphinx documentation

if "%SPHINXBUILD%" == "" (
        set SPHINXBUILD=sphinx-build
)
set SOURCEDIR=.
set BUILDDIR=_build

if "%1" == "" goto help

%SPHINXBUILD% >NUL 2>NUL
if errorlevel 9009 (
        echo.
        echo.The 'sphinx-build' command was not found. Make sure you have Sphinx
        echo.installed, then set the SPHINXBUILD environment variable to point
        echo.to the full path of the 'sphinx-build' executable. Alternatively you
        echo.may add the Sphinx directory to PATH.
        echo.
        echo.If you don't have Sphinx installed, grab it from
        echo.http://sphinx-doc.org/
        exit /b 1
)

%SPHINXBUILD% -M %1 %SOURCEDIR% %BUILDDIR% %SPHINXOPTS%
goto end

:help
%SPHINXBUILD% -M help %SOURCEDIR% %BUILDDIR% %SPHINXOPTS%

:end
popd

```

## docs/Makefile and docs/make.bat explanation

The main items to pay attention in these two files are:

- `SOURCEDIR = .` \
  This tells [sphinx][sphinx] that current directory (`docs`) is where
  the documentation source files are.
- `BUILDDIR = _build` \
  Sets-up the direction `_build` to be the output directory.

It is a good idea to add `_build` to the `.gitignore` file in `docs`.

## docs/conf.py

This is where most of the [sphinx][sphinx] relevant settings reside.  This
is what I am using:

<script src="https://tortugalabs.github.io/embed-like-gist/embed.js?style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on&fetchFromJsDelivr=on&target=https://github.com/TortugaLabs/mypielib/blob/main/docs/conf.py"></script>

This config file is loading version information from the module itself.
Other meta-data can be set here.

The following extensions are enabled:

- autodoc2 : generate documentation from doc strings
- myst_parser : Markdown
- sphinxarg.ext : Generate documentation from argument parser
- sphinx.ext.doctest : Enable doctest unit tests.

![myst+sphinx]({static}/images/2026/sphinx/myst-sphinx.png)

### autodoc2

- `autodoc2_packages` : configures what source directories to find doc strings
- `autodoc2_render_plugin = 'myst'` : We use markdown
- `autodoc2_sort_names = True` : keeps names sorted.  Otherwise the order is random.
- `autodoc2_hidden_objects = {'inherited','private'}` : hides inherited classes and
  names that begin with a *single* underscore.

### myst_parser

- `myst_enable_extensions` : Enable extensions:
  - `fieldlist` : Enables the use of `:key value:` in doc strings
  - `linkify` : Converts raw URLs into links
  - `substitution` : Lets you configure Jinja2 style substitutions.  See: `myst_substitutions`.
  - `strikethrough` : Enables `~~` markup.
  
### sphinx.ext.doctest

Enables unit tests in documentation.  Use:

- `doctest_global_setup` and
- `doctest_global_cleanup` to configure the execution environment

## docs/index.md

This is the main page for the generated HTML documentation.  Example
contents:

<script src="https://tortugalabs.github.io/embed-like-gist/embed.js?style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on&fetchFromJsDelivr=on&target=https://github.com/TortugaLabs/mypielib/blob/main/docs/index.md"></script>

In this example, we are using Jinja2 style substitutions.  These are defined
in the `conf.py` file in the `myst_substituions` dictionary.  Then, they
are refered in the document as `{{ key }}`.

The `{toctree}` structure is used to create a navigation tree.

The files listed there are the entry points for the documentation.
These files are created as [Markdown][myst] or possibly [reStructuredText][rst]
and reference here.

Important to note is the `apidocs/index`.  This file is generated **automatically**
by the `autodoc2` extension.

In this example, we are also referencing a file `cli.md`.  We are using this
to document command line arguments.

![markdown]({static}/images/2026/sphinx/markdown.png)


## docs/cli.md

This file is used by `index.md` and is used in the command line documentation.

Example content:

<script src="https://tortugalabs.github.io/embed-like-gist/embed.js?style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on&fetchFromJsDelivr=on&target=https://github.com/TortugaLabs/mypielib/blob/main/docs/cli.md"></script>

See [argparse usage][argparse-usage] on more details on how argparse is used.

## Docstrings

![docstrings]({static}/images/2026/sphinx/docstrings.png)

In your source code you can then use docstrings.  Here is an example:

<script src="https://tortugalabs.github.io/embed-like-gist/embed.js?style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on&fetchFromJsDelivr=on&target=https://github.com/TortugaLabs/mypielib/blob/main/mypielib/cidr_to_netmask.py"></script>

The example uses:

- `:param type varname: to document parameters to the function
- `:returns: to document the return value
- It makes use of `doctest` to document examples and/or execute tests.

# Generating documentation

In the `docs` directory you can:

- `make html` : to generate HTML documentation.  This will be placed in
  `_build/html`.
- `make man` : To generate a man page.  This will be placed in `_build/man`

![run make]({static}/images/2026/sphinx/runmake.png)


# Publish to gh-pages

![github pages]({static}/images/2026/sphinx/gh-pages.png)

If your project is hosted on [github][gh], you can publish the documentation directly
to [github-pages][pages] using a [github-action][action].

Enable this by navigating to your project settings.  Click on `Pages` on the left sidebar.
Change the **Source** to `GitHub Actions`.

![github actions]({static}/images/2026/sphinx/gh-actions.png)

Create the following workflow in `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`.


<script src="https://tortugalabs.github.io/embed-like-gist/embed.js?style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on&fetchFromJsDelivr=on&target=https://github.com/TortugaLabs/mypielib/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml"></script>

- `on:` section: what triggers the workflow to run
  - pushing to the default branch
  - `workflow_dispatch` let's you manually run the workflow from the Web UI's actions tab.
- Jobs:
  - build: Use sphinx to generate documentation
    - Checkout : Uses `fetch-depth: 0` to make sure we get tag data.
    - Setup Python : sets up python, enabling `pip` caching.
    - Install dependancies : uses the `docs/requirements.txt` file.
    - Generate sphinx documentation : Run sphinx with the HTML target
    - Afterwards, an artifact containing the web site is generated
  - deploy: This job is only run from the default branch and actually
    deploys the web site to [github-pages][pages].


After the first succesful run, clock on the gear widget next to your **About** repository web part.

# Conclusion

This article covers using [sphinx][sphinx] as a document generator for Python projects and
the eventual publishing of such documentation to [github pages][pages].  This particular
tutorial is geared towards using [Markdown][myst] as the markup dialect instead of
[reStructured Text][rst] as I personally find [Markdown][myst] easier to write.
