# Packaging code

- Put all python code in a directory
- Create `__init__.py`, which is used when importing the directory.
- Create `__main__.py`, which is called when running `python -m module`

# Things to watch

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
  - Interesting way for creating REST APIs.
- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/)
  - Not mature enough.  Let's wait until migrations are documented and decide them.

# More [sphinx][sphinx]

After using [sphinx][sphinx] for document generation I find it quite _prickly_
with the slightest mistake breaking thins and error messages that are very 
*uninformative*.

Todo:

- Jinja2 templates or other var substs
- conf.py
  - Handle meta variables
  - How source code is found
  - sphinxarg.ext - argparse auto docs
  - myst_parser - markdown
  - autodoc2 - automatic API doc generation
  - html_static_path


# Others
