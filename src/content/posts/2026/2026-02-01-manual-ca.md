As mentioned in the [[2026-01-15-cas.md|previous article]], 
there are some scenarios that it would be useful to run your own
Certificate Authority (CA).  For example:

- When you require a lot of certificates.
- Authenticate users or client devices.

It is possible to run your own mini Certificate Authority manually.

To request an SSL certificate from a CA like Verisign or GoDaddy, you send them a
Certificate Signing Request (CSR), and they give you an SSL certificate in return
that they have signed using their root certificate and private key. All browsers
have a copy (or access to a copy from the operating system) of the root certificate
from the various CAs, so the browser can verify that your certificate was signed by
a trusted CA.

That’s why when you generate a self-signed certificate the browser doesn’t trust it. It
hasn’t been signed by a CA. The way to get around this is to generate our own root
certificate and private key. We then add the root certificate to all the devices we
own just once, and then all the certificates we generate will be inherently trusted.

This tutorial uses OpenSSL.  OpenSSL is a free and open-source cryptographic library
that provides several command-line tools for handling digital certificates. Some of
these tools can be used to act as a certificate authority.


# Generating root cert

Acting as a certificate authority (CA) means dealing with cryptographic pairs of
private keys and public certificates. The very first cryptographic pair we’ll create
is the root pair. This consists of the root key (`ca.key.pem`) and root certificate
(`ca.cert.pem`). This pair forms the identity of your CA.

Typically, the root CA does not sign server or client certificates directly.
The root CA is only ever used to create one or more intermediate CAs, which are trusted
by the root CA to sign certificates on their behalf. This is best practice. It allows the
root key to be kept offline and unused as much as possible, as any compromise of the root
key is disastrous.

> Note
>
> It’s best practice to create the root pair in a secure environment. Ideally, this
> should be on a fully encrypted, air gapped computer that is permanently isolated
> from the Internet. Remove the wireless card and fill the ethernet port with glue.


## Preparation

Choose a directory (`/home/root-ca`) to store all keys and certificates.

```bash
# mkdir /home/root-ca
```


Create the directory structure. The `index.txt` and `serial` files act as a flat file
database to keep track of signed certificates.

```bash
# cd /home/root-ca
# mkdir certs csr crl newcerts private
# chmod 700 private
# touch index.txt
# echo 1000 > serial
```

You must create a configuration file for OpenSSL to use in `/home/root-ca/openssl.cnf`

```ini
# OpenSSL root CA configuration file.
# Copy to `/home/root-ca/openssl.cnf`.

[ ca ]
# `man ca`
default_ca = CA_default

[ CA_default ]
# Directory and file locations.
dir               = /home/root-ca

[ policy_loose ]

# Extensions for a typical intermediate CA (`man x509v3_config`).

nsCertType = server
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Server Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash

keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth

```

The `[ ca ]` section is mandatory. Here we tell OpenSSL to use the options from
the `[ CA_default ]` section.

The `[ CA_default ]` section contains a range of defaults. Make sure you declare the
directory you chose earlier (`/home/ca`).

We’ll apply `policy_strict` for all root CA signatures, as the root CA is only being
used to create intermediate CAs.

We’ll apply `policy_loose` for all intermediate CA signatures, as the intermediate CA is
signing server and client certificates that may come from a variety of third-parties.

Options from the `[ req ]` section are applied when creating certificates or certificate
signing requests.

The `[ req_distinguished_name ]` section declares the information normally required in a
certificate signing request. You can optionally specify some defaults.

The next few sections are extensions that can be applied when signing certificates.
For example, passing the `-extensions v3_ca` command-line argument will apply the options set
in `[ v3_ca ]`.

We’ll apply the `v3_ca` extension when we create the root certificate.

We’ll apply the `v3_ca_intermediate` extension when we create the intermediate
certificate. `pathlen:0` ensures that there can be no further certificate authorities
below the intermediate CA.

We’ll apply the `usr_cert` extension when signing client certificates, such as those used
for remote user authentication.

We’ll apply the `server_cert` extension when signing server certificates, such as those used
for web servers.


## Creating the root key

Create the root key (`ca.key.pem`) and keep it absolutely secure. Anyone in possession
of the root key can issue trusted certificates. Encrypt the root key with AES 256-bit encryption
and a strong password.

> Note
>
> Use 4096 bits for all root and intermediate certificate authority keys. You’ll
> still be able to sign server and client certificates of a shorter length.

```bash
# cd /home/root-ca
# openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:secretpassword -out private/ca.key.pem 4096
# chmod 400 private/ca.key.pem
```

## Creating the root certificate

Use the root key (`ca.key.pem`) to create a root certificate (`ca.cert.pem`). Give the
root certificate a long expiry date, such as twenty years. Once the root certificate
expires, all certificates signed by the CA become invalid.

> Warning
> 
> Whenever you use the req tool, you must specify a configuration file to use with the
> -config option, otherwise OpenSSL will default to /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf.

```bash
# cd /root/root-ca
# openssl req -config openssl.cnf \
      -passin pass:secretpassword \
      -key private/ca.key.pem \
      -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca \
      -out certs/ca.cert.pem \
      -subj "/C=NL/ST=ZH/O=Alice Ltd/CN=Alice Ltd Root CA"
# chmod 444 certs/ca.cert.pem
```

To verify the root certificate do:

```bash
# openssl x509 -noout -text -in certs/ca.cert.pem
```

The output shows:

- the `Signature Algorithm` used
- the dates of certificate `Validity`
- the `Public-Key` bit length
- the `Issuer`, which is the entity that signed the certificate
- the `Subject`, which refers to the certificate itself

The `Issuer` and `Subject` are identical as the certificate is self-signed.
Note that all root certificates are self-signed.

```text
        Issuer: C=NL, ST=ZH, O=Alice Ltd, CN=Alice Ltd Root CA
        Validity
            Not Before: May  8 22:29:26 2025 GMT
            Not After : May  3 22:29:26 2045 GMT
        Subject: C=NL, ST=ZH, O=Alice Ltd, CN=Alice Ltd Root CA
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (4096 bit)
```

The output also shows the **X509v3 extensions**. We applied the `v3_ca` extension, so the options
from `[ v3_ca ]` should be reflected in the output.

```text
        X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: 
                64:2B:BA:1A:12:9F:D2:B6:62:45:1D:EC:07:17:DC:DB:CA:E8:E9:A5
            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier: 
                64:2B:BA:1A:12:9F:D2:B6:62:45:1D:EC:07:17:DC:DB:CA:E8:E9:A5
            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:TRUE
            X509v3 Key Usage: critical
                Digital Signature, Certificate Sign, CRL Sign

```

## Minimalistic Root certificate

Alternatively you can take the minimalistic approach:

1. Create certificate directory
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/ca
   cd ~/ca
   ```
2. Generate the private key:
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:secretpassword -out myCA.key 4096
   ```
3. Generate root certificate:
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -passin pass:secretpassword -key myCA.key \
   		-sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem \
        -subj "/C=NL/ST=ZH/O=Alice Ltd/CN=Alice Ltd Root CA"
   ```
4. Verify certificate:
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -noout -text -in myCA.pem
   ```
You can skip the _intermediat certificate_ steps.

# Create intermediate cert

An intermediate certificate authority (CA) is an entity that can sign certificates on
behalf of the root CA. The root CA signs the intermediate certificate, forming a chain
of trust.

The purpose of using an intermediate CA is primarily for security. The root key can be kept
offline and used as infrequently as possible. If the intermediate key is compromised,
the root CA can revoke the intermediate certificate and create a new intermediate
cryptographic pair.

## Prepare the directory

The root CA files are kept in `/home/root-ca`. Choose a different directory (`/home/int-ca`)
to store the intermediate CA files.

```bash
# mkdir /home/int-ca
```

Create the same directory structure used for the root CA files. It’s convenient to
also create a `csr` directory to hold certificate signing requests.

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# mkdir certs crl csr newcerts private
# chmod 700 private
# touch index.txt
# echo 1000 > serial
```

Add a `crlnumber` file to the intermediate CA directory tree. `crlnumber` is used to
keep track of _certificate revocation lists_.

```bash
# echo 1000 > crlnumber
```

Create a file in `/home/int-ca/openssl.cnf`:

```ini
# OpenSSL intermediate CA configuration file.
# Copy to `/home/int-ca/openssl.cnf`.

[ ca ]
# `man ca`
default_ca = CA_default

[ CA_default ]
# Directory and file locations.

[ policy_loose ]

[ v3_ca ]
# Extensions for a typical CA (`man x509v3_config`).

basicConstraints = critical, CA:true, pathlen:0
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, cRLSign, keyCertSign

[ usr_cert ]
# Extensions for client certificates (`man x509v3_config`).
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = client, email

nsCertType = server
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Server Certificate"

keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth

```

Five options have changed compared to the root CA configuration file:

```ini
[ CA_default ]
dir             = /home/int-ca
private_key     = $dir/private/intermediate.key.pem
certificate     = $dir/certs/intermediate.cert.pem
crl             = $dir/crl/intermediate.crl.pem
policy          = policy_loose
```

## Create the intermediate key

Create the intermediate key (`intermediate.key.pem`). Encrypt the intermediate key with
AES 256-bit encryption and a strong password.

> This is done in the **intermediate CA**

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl genrsa -aes256 \
      -passout pass:secretpassword \
      -out private/intermediate.key.pem 4096
# chmod 400 private/intermediate.key.pem
```

## Create the intermediate certificate

Use the intermediate key to create a certificate signing request (CSR). The details
should generally match the root CA. The **Common Name**, however, must be different.

> Warning
> 
> Make sure you specify the intermediate CA configuration file
> (`/home/int-ca/openssl.cnf`).

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -sha256 \
      -passin pass:secretpassword \
      -key private/intermediate.key.pem \
      -out csr/intermediate.csr.pem \
      -subj "/C=NL/ST=ZH/O=Alice Ltd/CN=Alice Ltd Intermediate CA"
```

To create an intermediate certificate, use the root CA with the `v3_intermediate_ca`
extension to sign the intermediate CSR. The intermediate certificate should be valid
for a shorter period than the root certificate. Ten years would be reasonable.

Copy the intermeida certificates `csr` to the root CA.  If you follow
hard security practices you may need to manually copy the `csr` file to 
the air-gapped root CA system.  In our example, we simply copy:

```bash
# cp -av /home/int-ca/csr/intermediate.csr.pem /home/root-ca/csr
```

> Warning
> 
> This time, specify the root CA configuration file (`/home/root-ca/openssl.cnf`).

```bash
# cd /home/root-ca
# openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extensions v3_intermediate_ca \
      -days 3650 -notext -md sha256 \
      -passin pass:secretpassword \
      -in csr/intermediate.csr.pem \
      -out certs/intermediate.cert.pem

Sign the certificate? [y/n]: y
1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y

# chmod 444 certs/intermediate.cert.pem
```

The `index.txt` file is where the OpenSSL `ca` tool stores the certificate
database. Do not delete or edit this file by hand. It should now contain a line
that refers to the intermediate certificate.

```text
V	350506223334Z		1000	unknown	/C=NL/ST=ZH/O=Alice Ltd/CN=Alice Ltd Intermediate CA
```


## Verify the intermediate certificate

As we did for the root certificate, check that the details of the intermediate certificate are correct.

```bash
# openssl x509 -noout -text \
      -in certs/intermediate.cert.pem
```

Verify the intermediate certificate against the root certificate. An OK indicates that the
chain of trust is intact.

```bash
# openssl verify -CAfile certs/ca.cert.pem \
      certs/intermediate.cert.pem

intermediate.cert.pem: OK
```

## Create the certificate chain file

When an application (eg, a web browser) tries to verify a certificate signed by
the intermediate CA, it must also verify the intermediate certificate against the root
certificate. To complete the chain of trust, create a CA certificate chain to present
to the application.

To create the CA certificate chain, concatenate the intermediate and root certificates
together. We will use this file later to verify certificates signed by the intermediate CA.

```bash
# cat certs/intermediate.cert.pem \
      certs/ca.cert.pem > certs/intermediate-full-chain.cert.pem
# chmod 444 certs/intermediate-full-chain.cert.pem
```

> Note
>
> Our certificate chain file must include the root certificate because no client application
> knows about it yet. A better option, particularly if you’re administrating an intranet, is to
> install your root certificate on every client that needs to connect. In that case, the chain
> file need only contain your intermediate certificate.

At this point you need to copy from the root CA to the intermediate CA the files:

- certs/intermediate.cert.pem
- certs/intermediate-full-chain.cert.pem

```bash
cp -av /home/root-ca/certs/intermediate*.pem /home/int-ca/certs
```


## Minimalistic Approach

For the minimalistic approach, this entire section can be skipped.

# Signing client/server certificates


We will be signing certificates using our intermediate CA. You can use these signed
certificates in a variety of situations, such as to secure connections to a web server
or to authenticate clients connecting to a service.

> Note
>
> The steps below are from your perspective as the certificate authority. A third-party,
> however, can instead create their own private key and certificate signing request (CSR)
> without revealing their private key to you. They give you their CSR, and you give back a
> signed certificate. In that scenario, skip the genrsa and req commands.

## Create a key

Our root and intermediate pairs are 4096 bits. Server and client certificates normally expire
after one year, so we can safely use 2048 bits instead.

> Note
>
> Although 4096 bits is slightly more secure than 2048 bits, it slows down TLS handshakes
> and significantly increases processor load during handshakes. For this reason, most
> websites use 2048-bit pairs.

If you’re creating a cryptographic pair for use with a web server (eg, Apache), you probably
want to create a key without a password so that you don't need to enter the password
every time you restart the web server:

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl genrsa  \
      -out private/www.example.com.key.pem 2048
# chmod 400 private/www.example.com.key.pem
```

On the other hand, if you are creating a key for an interactive user, creating
a key with password would be beneficial:

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl genrsa  \
	  -aes256 \
      -passout pass:secretpassword \
      -out private/user.alice.key.pem 2048
# chmod 400 private/user.alice.key.pem
```

## Create a certificate

Use the private key to create a certificate signing request (CSR). The CSR details don’t
need to match the intermediate CA. For server certificates, the **Common Name** must be a
fully qualified domain name (eg, `www.example.com`), whereas for client certificates it can
be any unique identifier (eg, an e-mail address). Note that the **Common Name** cannot be the
same as either your root or intermediate certificate.

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl req -config openssl.cnf \
      -key private/www.example.com.key.pem \
      -new -sha256 -out csr/www.example.com.csr.pem \
      -subj "/C=NL/CN=www.example.com"
```

For the user case you may use:

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl req -config openssl.cnf \
      -passin pass:secretpassword \
      -key private/user.alice.key.pem \
      -new -sha256 -out csr/user.alice.csr.pem \
      -subj "/C=NL/CN=user.alice/emailAddress=alice@example.com"
```

To create a certificate, use the intermediate CA to sign the CSR. If the certificate is
going to be used on a server, use the `server_cert` extension. If the certificate is going to be
used for user authentication, use the `usr_cert` extension. Certificates are usually given a
validity of one year, though a CA will typically give a few days extra for convenience.


```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl ca -config openssl.cnf \
      -passin pass:secretpassword \
      -extensions server_cert -days 375 -notext -md sha256 \
      -in csr/www.example.com.csr.pem \
      -out certs/www.example.com.cert.pem
# chmod 444 certs/www.example.com.cert.pem
```

The intermediate/index.txt file should contain a line referring to this new certificate.

```text
V	350506223334Z		1000	unknown	/C=NL/ST=ZH/O=Alice Ltd/CN=Alice Ltd Intermediate CA
```

For the user case you may use:

```bash
# cd /home/int-ca
# openssl ca -config openssl.cnf \
      -passin pass:secretpassword \
      -extensions usr_cert -days 375 -notext -md sha256 \
      -in csr/user.alice.csr.pem \
      -out certs/user.alice.cert.pem
# chmod 444 certs/user.alice.cert.pem
```

## Verify the certificate

```bash
# openssl x509 -noout -text \
      -in certs/www.example.com.cert.pem
```

The `Issuer` is the intermediate CA. The `Subject` refers to the certificate itself.

```text
        Issuer: C=NL, ST=ZH, O=Alice Ltd, CN=Alice Ltd Intermediate CA
        Validity
            Not Before: May  8 23:42:47 2025 GMT
            Not After : May 18 23:42:47 2026 GMT
        Subject: C=NL, CN=www.example.com
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)
```

The output will also show the `X509v3` extensions. When creating the certificate, you used
either the `server_cert` or `usr_cert` extension. The options from the corresponding configuration section will be reflected in the output.

                TLS Web Server Authentication
```

Use the CA certificate chain file we created earlier (`ca-chain.cert.pem`) to verify that the
new certificate has a valid chain of trust.

```bash
# openssl verify -CAfile certs/intermediate-full-chain.cert.pem \
      certs/www.example.com.cert.pem

www.example.com.cert.pem: OK
```

## Deploy the certificate

You can now either deploy your new certificate to a server, or distribute the certificate
to a client. When deploying to a server application (eg, Apache), you need to make the following
files available:

    intermediate-full-chain.cert.pem
    www.example.com.key.pem
    www.example.com.cert.pem

If you’re signing a CSR from a third-party, you don’t have access to their private key
so you only need to give them back the chain file (`ca-chain.cert.pem`) and the 
certificate (`www.example.com.cert.pem`).


## Minimal approach

1. Create private key:
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out www.example.com.key 2048
   ```
2. Generate CSR:
   ```bash
   openssl req -new \
   			-key www.example.com.key \
            -out www.example.com.csr \
            -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:foo.co.uk, DNS:*.app.example.com" \
            -subj "/C=NL/CN=www.example.com"
   ```
3. Create the certificate: using our CSR, the CA private key and the CA certificate:
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req \
          -passin pass:secretpassword \
          -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial \
          -days 825 -sha256 \
          -copy_extensions copyall \
          -in www.example.com.csr \
          -out www.example.com.crt
   ```

We now have three files: `www.example.com.key` (the private key), `www.example.com.csr` (the
certificate signing request, or csr file), and `www.example.com.crt` (the signed certificate).
We can configure local web servers to use HTTPS with the private key and the signed certificate.

# Conclusion

This articles covers two approaches for running Certificate Authorities only
using `openssl` commands.

The full approach can be implementely quite
securely and explicitly support server and client certificates.

The minimal approach is quite straight forward for a quick and dirty solution.
