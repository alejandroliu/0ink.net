In 2014, Microsoft [killed and buried Clipart](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clip-art-gone-heres-find-free-images-instead/)
in the digital graveyard.

Clipart had outlived its usefulness as users relied more on search
engines than Microsoft' somewhat limited supply through the Office
suite.

Today' clipart needs to be modern, colorful, and less cartoonish. An
online search for clip art images will net you files that are of far
better quality and relevance. But you need shortcuts when searching for
the right image is a daily workout.

These are *13 of the top websites* for free clipart downloads. Browse
through them and bookmark the ones that meet your needs.

* [clker.com](http://www.clker.com/) : This site is among the more neatly designed ones you can expect to find for clipart hunting. The images are free to download and use. All images are in the public domain, so feel free to use them anywhere after agreeing to the site' terms of use policy.
* [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/vector-clipart-free-download) : Vecteezy
  covers the gamut of vector art -from vector icons to vector patterns. Both free and premium
  image files are available for use. You can visit the small section for free vector clipart
  downloads which is still choc-full of nearly *75000* assets. The community contributions keep the
  artwork fresh and updated.
* [ClipArt Etc.](http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/) : Start with any of the *71,500* clip art images on this simple site. The site keeps its focus on classroom friendly images that are appropriate for school websites, class projects, student reports, homework assignments, presentations, posters, art projects, picture books, bulletin boards, and creating teaching aids. For instance, go over to the Fractions collection that has nearly 500 files to help demonstrate math concepts in class.
* [Webweaver' Free Clipart](http://www.webweaver.nu/) : Free images and animations without the annoyance of pop ups or registration. That' how this simple site announces itself, and it lives up to its name. Clip art categories include Holidays, Animals & Nature, Celebrations, Historical, and even a dedicated one for Fantasy. No Game of Thrones here, but I spotted a few that could be passed off as Gandalf from LOTR.
* [Clipart Of](http://www.clipartof.com/) : Clipart Of is a stock image website offering royalty-free vector, cartoon and 3D files, illustrations and clipart from artists around the world. One glance at the home page tells you that the quality is better than the average. But you have to pay for them.

The files are neatly categorized and you can also use the Google custom search engine to go through the vast collection. Some useful categories include Shapes Signs & Symbols, Math, Callouts, and Stickmen & Figures.
* [Clipart Lord](http://www.clipartlord.com/) : There' nothing remarkable about the site apart from the fact that someone has gone to the pains of collecting the best clip art found over the web. If you are a clip art buff then the simple site is worth a bookmark. I usually find some excellent files here and use them in my projects.
* [Vector Portal](http://www.vectorportal.com/StockVectors/Clip-art/) : The site
  creates and showcases free stock vectors which designers can use in commercial
  projects. The library includes a good collection of stock vectors and clip art
  images which you can use with an attribution. Vector Portal allows you non-exclusive,
  non-transferable right to use and modify its images which carry a "or commercial use"  license. Most of the files are in the EPS and AI formats (supported by Adobe Illustrator).
