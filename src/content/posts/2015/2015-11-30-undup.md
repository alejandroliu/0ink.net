So, after a long while, I wrote a new C language program. As usual,
the same things that I dislike about C programming popped up,
specifically the need for low level data structures and manual
memory management.

I did learn some new things:

*   [uthash](https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash/) : I have used this library before, but there were a few new features that I did not know before, specifically it not only includes the hash library, but also some other _high level_ structures that were quite handy.
*   Unit testing : So I started using [cu](https://github.com/danfis/cu/), a C unit testing library. Frst time I write a program with integrated unit-testing. I can see its usefulness, but it does feel like a lot of work. For a casual programmer like myself, does feel like an over-kill.
*   Continuous integration with [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org/alejandroliu/undup) : For this project I tried using a CI tool. I chose [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org/) because it integrates with [GitHub](http://github.com/). This only makes sense with unit testing. Once again, for a casual programmer like myself, it feels like a bit too much, but I can see how it would be useful if you have multiple contributors to the same project repository.
*   Creating binaries for a Zyxel NSA 325 v2 : So I got the NSA 325v2 SDK, and I am cross compiling for it. Quite straightforward, but still, something new.
*   An interesting feature of this code, is that, when possible, it is object oriented.

Anyway, this project can be found in github:

*   [Undup github repository](https://github.com/alejandroliu/undup)
