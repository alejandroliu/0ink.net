![atom]({static}/images/2015/atom.png)

As an old UNIX guy I have been using
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) for years.
So in a way, I am very comfortable with using it and most of keyboard
shortcuts. But, it really is an old animal and I have been thinking
that I should be moving to a more modern replacement to it for quite
a while.

My latest attempt (and the most serious attempt to date) has been
trying [atom](http://atom.io/). [Atom](http://atom.io/) is a new
editor from the makers of [github](https://github.com/) which claims
to have been inspired by [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html)
and also supports the latest web technologies.

After using it for some time, I found the following conclusions:

1.  I am really used to using CTRL + key to move around. And switching to the dedicated arrow and home/end keys feels like a step backwards. I might be old fashioned, but it really is about keeping your fingers in the keyboard "home" row. Also, while the arrow keys are easy to find, I have trouble with the home/end keys (which apparently I use a lot when programming). Specially because I switch between a laptop and full size keyboard all the time.
2.  I really like the automatic programming style automation in Emacs.
3.  I miss the record macro/execute macro facility of Emacs.
4.  The automatic "(" inserts ")" really annoys me.
5.  Browsing for extensions in "Atom" seems a bit non-intuitive to me.
6.  I am used to using the command line and open the files in a running editor directly from there. I am able to configure emacs to do this, it is not clear to me how to do this with Atom yet.
7.  I don't know why I am so used to the [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) CTRL+S (search) functionality.

The following things I really like:

1.  Syntax highlighting is quite solid
2.  The project view pane is very useful.
3.  The Markdown preview pane.

So up to know, looks promising but I am not convinced. I still using [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) specially because it sometimes feel that [atom](http://atom.io/) is slow to start.
