Code Kingdoms is targeted towards six- to 13-year olds and looks very
much like your everyday puzzle adventure game. Choose an animal, walk
around a kingdom saving animals through puzzles. The difference is
most of the puzzles require kids to use code elements to solve the
puzzles. At first this is through dragging-and-dropping code snippets,
but as they progress, kids will be typing in code themselves.

Besides teaching actual JavaScript through play, Code Kingdoms
also helps kids develop problem-solving skills and the encouragement
to keep pushing on when they're faced with a challenge in the
game-much like programmers often have to push through challenging
walls.
