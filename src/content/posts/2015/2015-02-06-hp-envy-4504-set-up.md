I bought a HP Envy 4504.  Overall I am happy with it.  This is how
I configure it so I can use with Linux.

This mini howto applies to ArchLinux, void linux and Centos/RedHat distributions.


## Installation

Archlinux:

    cups, hplip, python2, sane
    

Centos:

    cups, hplip, hplip-gui, sane

Some optional dependancies may be needed.


void linux:

    hplip-gui

And for scanning, install:

  simple-scan and/or xsane



## Configuration Arch Linux and Centos/RedHat

```
sudo systemctl enable cups
sudo systemctl start cups
sudo hp-setup
```

hp-setup -i Select "Network", and "Advanced Options -> Manual Discovery" Printer: npr1 PPD File:

    /usr/share/ppd/HP/hp-envy_4500_series.ppd

Uncoment `hpaio` from `/etc/sane/dll.conf`.

## void linux configuration

These are void linux specific settings:

enable cups:

```
ln -s /etc/sv/cupsd /var/service
```

uncompress PPD file (otherwise it is not recognized)

```
gunzip /usr/share/ppd/HP/hp-envy_4500_series.ppd.gz
```

We need to hack the install `/usr/share/hplip/prnt/cups.py`
so that it runs:

+                            path = ppd # foomatic: or some other driver
 
                     ppds[path] = desc
                     #log.debug("%s: %s" % (path, desc))
```

Add printer (run with `sudo`):

```
print_host=npr1
hp-setup $print_host
```

For scanning, uncoment `hpaio` from `/etc/sane/dll.conf`.


## Tweaks

Some commands:

```
lpstat -p
cupsenable printer
```

Also since it is a WIFI printer no  To prevent thisrmally it will go into sleep/power
save mode. This means if you then try to print from cups it will fail
(printer is asleep). Subsequent prints should work but now cupsd has
flagged the printer as paused.  To prevent this you should run this
command as root:

```
lpadmin -p ENVY_4500 -o printer-error-policy=retry-job
```

More configuration commands:

- Set default paper size:
  - `echo a4 > /etc/papersize`



* * *

- 2020-03-09 : Removed:
  - To prevent this you should configure
    the default `ErrorPolicy` in `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` by adding in the top
    scope: "ErrorPolicy retry-job"
