As part of my small project of movng my Z-Wave Hub to a Raspberry PI, I got an
[X728][x728] kit.  This has:

- UPS controller board
  - RTC circuit
  - Battery and Power control board
- Case
  - Button
  - Cooling fan
  - Additional Battery holder

The case has holes for wall-mounting.

The Geekworm X728 kit is very easy to build.  There is a video to show how to do
this:

- [Build video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOG30LXb6ds&t)

Otherwise, refer to the hardware guide [here](http://wiki.geekworm.com/X728-hardware).

In my case, before the build, I took the disassembled case to measure the holes
needed for wall-mounting the case. You need fairly small screws for this. I
actually had to bend the case slighly for my screws to work.

Also, I set the jumper to automatic Power-on and a few cable ties to fix a USB Hub
to the case.

To test the hardware I downloaded a 64-bit Raspberry OS Lite image from
[Raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) and
image an micro-SD card.

- Boot the Raspberry OS.  The first boot will resize the filesystems, so please
  wait.  Also, it will let you configure the default user and password.
- Enable the i2c function:
  - `sudo raspi-config`
  - Go to `Interfacing Options` -> `I2C - Enable/Disable automatic loading`.
  - While you are at-it, you may also enable `SSH`.
- Alternatively, you can a manual install by:
  - Modify the `config.txt` in the `/boot` partition:
  - Add at the end:
  - `[all]`
  - `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`
- Install pre-requisites:
  - `sudo apt-get update`
  - `sudo apt-get upgrade`
  - `sudo apt-get -y install i2c-tools`
  - This is only needed for `i2cdetect`.
- Reboot the system.
- Check if the hardware is detected:
  - `sudo i2cdetect -y 1`
  - ![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/master/snippets/2022/X728/imgs/X728x-i2c.png)
  - `#36` - the address of the battery fuel gauging chip
  - `#68` - the address of the RTC chip
  - Different x728 versions may have different values.  Mine used these values.

I personally did not like the example software.  This can be found in [github][ghg].
Specifically, the `shutdown` functionality seemed to have [race-conditions][rc].

However, using it is not that complicated.  So I wrote my own software, but you
can do your own thing:

# RTC functionality

The RTC functionality is supported by the Raspberry OS kernel.  You need to enable
the `i2c` functionality in `/boot/config.txt` by adding the line:

```config
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
```
With that enabled, you need to add the kernel modules:

```
i2c-dev
rtc-ds1307
```

You need to enable it in the bus:

```bash
echo ds1307 0x68 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device
```

From then on, you can use the standard `hwclock` command.

These can be added to `rc.local` which is how the sample code does.  I prefer to
do this from a script run from `systemd` unit file:

```conf
# file: /etc/systemd/system/x728clock.service

[Unit]
Description=Restore / save X728 clock
DefaultDependencies=no
Before=sysinit.target shutdown.target
Conflicts=shutdown.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/etc/x728/clock.sh start
ExecStop=/etc/x728/clock.sh stop
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target

```

After saving this file and creating a `/etc/x728/clock.sh` script you can:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x728clock
systemctl start x728clock
systemctl disable fake-hwclock
systemctl stop fake-hwclock
```

- [systemd unit file](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/x728clock.service)
- [script](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/scripts/clock.sh)


# GPIO assignments

| Pin | Function | Direction | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| #6 | PLD | in | 1: A/C lost, 0: A/C OK |
| #5 | 5hutdown | in | Sense button press |
| #12 | Boot | out | Control SW/HW controlled button |
| #20 | Buzzer | out | |
| #26 | Button | out | Simulate power button press |

- Reading `PLD` detects if the A/C power is available or not.  If it reads `1`
  A/C power was lost.  `0` if A/C power is available.
- `Buzzer` if set to `1` it will sound a rather loud beep.  `0` for off.
- `Button` simulates pressing the hardware `Off` button.  If you set `Button`
  to `1` for 6 seconds, the system will poweroff.
- `Shutdown` is used to read the status of the hardware button.  This works only
  if `Boot` is set to `1`.  Otherwise, `Shutdown` doesn't seem to work.
  When `Boot` is set to `1`, it would read `1` if pressed, `0` if released.
  Weirdly enough, the `Shutdown` button is not very sensitive.  It takes about
  3 seconds to register the button press.  The button release takes bout 50
  seconds to detect.

# GPIO programming

Programming GPIO is quite easy.  It can be done from shell scripting using the
sys file-system.

```bash
gpioIO() {
  local pin=$1
  if [ $# -eq 1 ] ; then
    cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio$pin/value
  else
    echo "$2" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio$pin/value
  fi
}

gpioInit() {
  local name="$1" pin="$2" dir="$3"

  [ ! -d /sys/class/gpio/gpio$pin ] && echo "$pin" > /sys/class/gpio/export
  echo $dir > /sys/class/gpio/gpio$pin/direction

  eval "gpio${name}() { gpioIO $pin \"\$@\" ; }"
}
ticks() {
  echo $(date +%s)$(date +%N | cut -c-2)
}

beep() {
  local len="$1" ; shift

  gpioBUZZER 1
  sleep "$len"
  gpioBUZZER 0

  [ $# -eq 0 ] && return

  local repeat="$1" idle
  [ $# -gt 1 ] && idle="$2" || idle="$len"

  while [ $repeat -gt 1 ]
  do
    repeat=$(expr $repeat - 1)
    sleep "$idle"
    gpioBUZZER 1
    sleep "$len"
    gpioBUZZER 0
  done
}

gpioInit SHUTDOWN 5 in
gpioInit PLD 6 in
gpioInit BOOT 12 out
gpioInit BUZZER 20 out
gpioInit BUTTON 26 out

```

Afterwards, you can just:

- `gpio[PIN]` to read, i.e:
  - `gpioSHUTDOWN`
  - `gpioPLD`
- `gpio[PIN] {1|0}` to write i.e.:
  - `gpioBOOT 1`
  - `gpioBUZER 0`

# Reading Battery status

You can read battery voltage and battery charge from the `smbus`.  To read the `smbus`
I am using an example from [rpi-examples]((https://github.com/leon-anavi/rpi-examples/tree/master/BMP180/c).
Specifically, I am only using the files `smbus.c` and `smbus.h` from that repository.

The code outline is:

- open `/dev/i2c-1` in read/write mode.
- `ioctl(fd, I2C_SLAVE, I2C_ADDRESS)` where `I2C_ADDRESS = 0x36`.
- From `smbus.c` read `i2c_smbus_read_word_data(fd, address)`, and byte swap.
- Voltage can be read from address `2`:
  - `Voltage = (swapped) * 1.25 / 1000 / 16`
- Battery charge can be read from address `4`:
  - `Battery = (swapped) / 256`

The code to do this can be found on [github](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/tree/master/snippets/2022/X728/src).

A precompiled 64bit static binary can be found there too.

# Power down

The [x728][x728] will turn off power by holding down the power button for around
6 seconds.  Doing this will skip the `shutdown` process.  Also, if you execute the
`poweroff` command, the Raspberry Pi will shutdown but power will not go **OFF** until
you hold the power button for 6 seconds.

For this to work properly, I am adding this small script to `/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/gpio-poweroff`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#
# file: /lib/systemd/system-shutdown/gpio-poweroff
# $1 will be either "halt", "poweroff", "reboot" or "kexec"
#

BUTTON=26

op_poweroff() {
  echo $BUTTON > /sys/class/gpio/export
  echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio$BUTTON/direction
  echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio$BUTTON/value
  sync;sync;sync
  sleep 7
  echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio$BUTTON/value
  sleep 3
}

case "$1" in
  poweroff) op_poweroff ;;
esac

```

This hooks into `systemd`'s `shutdown` target and uses the `BUTTON` pin to
simulate holding the button for 6 seconds to force the UPS board to power off.

- [script](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/gpio-poweroff)

# UPS management

In addition, I wrote a small script to:

- graceful shutdown when power button is pressed.
  - hold the power button, after approximately 3 seconds, you will hear
    2 beeps.  YOu can release the power button then.  The system will
    do a graceful shutdown and power down.
- When A/C power is lost:
  - If battery status can not be determined, the system will do a graceful
    powerdown.
  - If battery status can be read, it will beep once every 60 seconds until
    power is restored.
  - If battery is low, it will do a graceful powerdown.
- Events are written to /dev/kmsg, so they could be forwarded to a syslog server.

The files to do this are:

- [systemd unit file](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/x728ups.service)
- [upsmon.sh](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/scripts/upsmon.sh)


# Home Assistant

I am using the [X728 kit][x728] for creating a [Home Assistant][ha] installation.
[Home Assistant][ha] has a "managed Operating System" called
[Home Assistant OS][hassos] which is a mostly read-only installation.  This
makes it complicated to add your own "low-level" customizations.  To include
these scripts and making them persistant accross upgrades I am hooking into the
[RAUC OTA][rauc] upgrade subsystem.

For that, I hook up to the [System handlers](https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#system-based-customization-handlers)
which makes use of a [Handler Interface](https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#sec-handler-interface).

With these scripts, I am able to move the customizations from a previous image
to the new upgraded image.

For this, I have a script [haos-x728](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/OTA/haos-x728.sh)
that injects the customizations
into a new installation image.  This script also modifies `/etc/rauc/system.conf`
so that the customization handler is called during an upgrade.

The [post-install handler](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/OTA/post-install)
re-adds the handler to `/etc/rauc/system.conf`
and copies the necessary files to the updated image.

The customization scripts are *not* [X728][x728] specific, and essentially lets
you copy all the files in a directory to the custom image.  As such, I am using
to not only inject these [X728][x728] scripts, but also the `vcgencmd` and a
`muninlite` agent.  Also, the dependant binaries for the
[post-install handler](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/OTA/post-install)
are injected in the same way.

For the [post-install handler](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/OTA/post-install)
to work properly you need to copy binaries for:

- `gensquashfs`
- `sqfs2tar`

And dependant shared libraries (that are not part of the [Home Assistant OS][hassos]
image:

- `liblz4.so.1`
- `liblz4.so.1.9.3`
- `liblzma.so.5`
- `liblzma.so.5.2.5`
- `liblzo2.so.2`
- `liblzo2.so.2.0.0`
- `libselinux.so.1`
- `libsquashfs.so.1`
- `libsquashfs.so.1.1.0`
- `libzstd.so.1`
- `libzstd.so.1.4.8`

The simplest way to get these is to install `squashfs-tools-ng` on standard
`Raspberry PI OS` and copy those files from there.

The full set of customization files that I am using can be found
[here](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/2022/X728/OTA/x728rootfs.tar.gz).

It contains:

RAUC handler:

- `lib/rauc/post-install`

`squashfs-tools-ng` (dependancy to RAUC handler)

- `bin/gensquashfs`
- `bin/sqfs2tar`
- `lib/liblz4.so.1`
- `lib/liblz4.so.1.9.3`
- `lib/liblzma.so.5`
- `lib/liblzma.so.5.2.5`
- `lib/liblzo2.so.2`
- `lib/liblzo2.so.2.0.0`
- `lib/libselinux.so.1`
- `lib/libsquashfs.so.1`
- `lib/libsquashfs.so.1.1.0`
- `lib/libzstd.so.1`
- `lib/libzstd.so.1.4.8`

- `bin/x728batt`
- `etc/x728/clock.sh`
- `etc/x728/upsmon.sh`
- `etc/systemd/system/x728clock.service`
- `etc/systemd/system/x728ups.service`
- `etc/systemd/system/sysinit.target.wants/x728clock.service`
- `etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/x728ups.service`
- `lib/systemd/system-shutdown/gpio-poweroff`
