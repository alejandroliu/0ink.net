This comes in handy when working at a **colo** or someplace where you
don't have a mouse and then find yourself needing to use _X11_. Press
the following key combo:

```
Ctrl-Shift-Numlock
```

Now you can control the mouse pointer using the number pad.  The
key bindings are:

# Move the mouse pointer

- 7, 8, 9 are the up directions
- 4, 6 are left and right
- 1, 2, 3 are the down directions

# To control the mouse buttons

- `/` selects the left mouse button
- `*` selects the middle mouse button
- `-` selects the right mouse button

This only selects the mouse button but does not press it.  To
actually use the mouse button:

- `5` mouse click
- `+` double mouse click
- `0` to press and hold the mouse button (e.g. for dragging)
- `.` to release the currently mouse button.

For example, to do a mouse-click with the middle button you
first press the `*` key and then `5` to click.
