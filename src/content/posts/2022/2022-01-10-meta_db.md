So I was looking for a way to version control database schemas,
but I never found something that worked for me.  I found all
these options that never seem to match what I wanted:

- [metabase](http://freecode.com/projects/metabase)
- [dbv](https://github.com/victorstanciu/dbv)
- [delta sql](http://deltasql.sourceforge.net/features.php)
- [Propel](http://propelorm.org/)
- [phinx](https://phinx.org/)
- [doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/)
- [redbeanphp](https://redbeanphp.com/index.php)

At the end, I finally began doing the following.

The first schema release, I would create a file called:

- init-1.0.sql

This would contain all the sql statements needed to initialize
the database.  To indicate this is the current version I would
create a symlink to it:

- init.sql -> init-1.0.sql

The next schema update I would create file with the commands
to transform the schema.  i.e. additional `CREATE DATABASE` or
`ALTER TABLE` etc.

- upgrade-1.1.sql

So actually, the `upgrade` file would be the working version
used for development.  For release then I would create a
new `init` file.  Either doing it manually or by doing:

```bash
cat init-1.0.sql upgrade-1.1.sql > init-1.1.sql
```

To indicate that this is the current version, the symlink would
be updated:

- init.sql -> init-1.1.sql

# Final notes

This would end-up with a history of schema changes and scripts that
could be used to upgrade the database schema from any version to
any later version.
