title: Graphviz markdown extensions
---

I have enabled several extensions to my [pelican][peli] website.

One that I wanted to include was [graphviz][gvs].  So, I searched
for one and while I found a few, they somehow, did not work for me.

So I wrote my own: [mdx_graphviz](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/src/mdx/mdx_graphviz.py).

It is quite straight forward.  You just need to create blocks:

```
dot {
    digraph G {
        rankdir=LR
        Earth [peripheries=2]
        Mars
        Earth -> Mars
    }
}
```

You can use this [Graphviz Visual Editor][gvedit] for a more
interactive approach.
