I am busy moving away from my [VeraEdge](https://support.getvera.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021753434-VeraEdge-Getting-Started-How-To)
installation to a [Home Assistant][ha] running on a [Raspberry Pi 4][rpi4].  This is
because it looks like the maker of the VeraEdge was bought and it is slowly being
phased out.

For this I am using the following parts:

- [Geekwork X728 18650 UPS + X728-C1 case](http://wiki.geekworm.com/X728) : This
  provides with a case (with cooling fan), UPS and RTC functionality.
- [Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5+](https://aeotec.com/products/aeotec-z-stick-gen5/) : For
  Z-Wave compatibility.
- [ConBee 2](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2) : For ZigBee compatibility.
- A Raspberry Pi 4 - 4GB
- 64GB SD Card.  Actually I wanted to use a 32GB SD card, but the 64GB had better
  specs and was only a couple os bucks more expensive.

I will be reusing these components:

- [Smart Meter USB-P1 cable](https://www.robbshop.nl/slimme-meter-kabel-usb-p1-1-meter)
- [RFXtrx433XL USB HA controller](http://www.rfxcom.com/RFXtrx433XL-USB-43392MHz-Transceiver)

# Hardware build

Building the case is simple and straight forward.  You can follow this
video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOG30LXb6ds).

The steps are:

- Open the case.
- Install the fan.
- Install the additional battery holder.
- Install the power button.
- Screw the spacers to the Raspberry Pi.
- Insert the X728 UPS hat on top and screw in place.
- Install batteries.
- Plug connectors.
- Screw the Raspberry Pi to the case.
- Test that everything is in working order.
- Optional: Set the jumper selector to auto power-on.
- Close the case.

# Case software

I did not like the software that comes with the case, so I rolled-up
my own.  The RTC uses the standard `rtc-ds1307` which is in the Linux
kernel.  For GPIO programming I am using the `/sysfs` interface.  The
only component that requires _custom_ programming was the battery
charge and voltage readings.  For that I wrote a small C program.

- [x728batt](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/tree/master/snippets/X728/src)

This is tied to `systemd` through these files:

- [/etc/systemd/system/x728clock.service](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/X728/x728clock.service)
  executes [clock.sh](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/X728/scripts/clock.sh)
  This is used to load the RTC kernel modules and activate the RTC in the
  i^^2^^c bus.
- [/etc/systemd/system/x728ups.service](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/X728/x728ups.service)
  executes [upsmon.sh](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/X728/scripts/upsmon.sh)
  This is used to monitor the Push Button, the A/C power status and if the
  A/C power is lost, the battery status.  It will trigger a graceful shutdown
  if the button is pressed or if the battery charge is insufficient.
- [/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/gpio-poweroff](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/X728/gpio-poweroff)
  This is used to turn off the UPS power if the user issues the `poweroff`
  command.

In addition to this, I created a script to inject the [Home Assistant][ha]
Raspberry Pi image with the relevant files and also adds a
[RAUC post-install handler](https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#system-configuration-file).
so that OTA upgrades will keep these customizations.

As a bonus I am adding a [munin-node](https://github.com/TortugaLabs/muninlite)
systemd unit for system monitoring.  And yes, I am old-fashioned.

Also, I am enabling `ssh` to the underlying Operating System.


# Home Assistant installation

Following the raspberry pi installation [guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/)
is quite straight forward.

I chose to use the HAOS image install as it gives a more _consumer device_
experience.

- Download the 64bit image for Raspberry Pi 4 from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases)
- Use the [haos-x728.sh](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/tree/master/snippets/X728/OTA)
  to customize the image to include my X728 files.
- Write the modified image to SD card.

Boot the raspberry pi from the new SD card and do the GUI installation.
For my case, I needed to login to my router to look-up the IP address.
It is configured via DHCP.  I also statically assign an IP address and DNS
name based on MAC address.  To make sure that the DNS name and the host name
match, I modified it on the configuration:

`Settings` -> `System` -> `network`

Modify `hostname`.

# Initial configuration

Set up home areas.  I set-up one area per room, following a naming convention:

F __floor-number__ __Room-name__

For example:

- `F0 Kitchen`
- `F2 Attic`

Also, create additional areas for:

- `External` : External items
- `System` : System related entities and devices

For devices, I am using this naming convention:

- __Room-name__ __room-section__ __device__ __optional__

The idea is to make it simple to guess the name for voice recognition.

- __Room-name__ : this should match the area.
- __room-section__ : **optional**, section of the room this applies to.
- __device__ : device type.
  - Chromecast : google chromecast device
  - Display : google nest hub
  - TV : with optional __casting__, __upnp__ or __api__
  - Skylight
  - Light
  - Switch
  - Double Switch
  - Remote: Remote control
  - Window Sensor
  - Door Sensor
- __optional__ : used for when multiple device of the same type are in the same room.


# Add-Ons

I installed the followng add-ons:

- Home Assistant Community Add-ons
  - [Studio Code Server](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-vscode) : for
    editing files.  Press ==F1== and start typing `home assistant` to view
    available integration commands.  This is needed because (unfortunately)
    not everything can be configured through the UI.
  - [Z-Wave JS UI](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave-js-ui) : Instead
    of __Official add-ons__.  The community add-on gives you a control panel with
    more detailed control featires.  Specifically you can set group associations.

Also, adding my own repository: https://github.com/iliu-net/hassio-addons

- rsync-folders : save data and backups to remote server using rsync
- watchdogdev : watchdog timer

# Further Configuration

These configurations require modifying files.  So usually I would do them
**after** installing `Studio Code Server`.

## Modifying authentications

To simplify login in local networks (specially to support physical
control panels) I configured the
[trusted_networks](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#trusted-networks)
by adding the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
homeassistant:
  auth_providers:
    - type: trusted_networks
      trusted_networks:
      - 192.168.2.0/24
```

Essentially what this does is that devices connecting from the
_trusted networks_ do not to login with username/password.

## System temperature

For fun I also configured a CPU temperature sensor.  Add this
to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  ### command line
  - platform: command_line
    name: CPU Temperature
    command: "cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp" # RPi
    # command: "cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/temp" # NUC
    # If errors occur, remove degree symbol below
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    value_template: "{{ '%.1f' | format(value | multiply(0.001)) }}" # RPi & NUC
    unique_id: sys_cpu_temp
```


# Integrations

## DSMR Slimme Meter

[This](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dsmr) integration is to read
energy consumption as provided by NL smart meters.  Just make sure that
you get the right cable.  I am using a cable from
[ROBBshop](https://www.robbshop.nl/slimme-meter-kabel-usb-p1-1-meter).  Just
plug and add to the integrations.

To include:

- `Add Integration` : `DSMR Slimme Meter`
- `Serial` : connection
- `Select device`: Select the right serial port  (should be easy to identify).
- `DSMR Version` : `5`

This is very easy to add and configure.

## ZigBee Home Automation

[This](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha) integration is automatically
discovered for supported coordinators.  I am using
a [ConBee II](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2) ZigBee coordinator.  As long as the
device is supported (see
[compatibility list](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/index.html) ) things are fairly
easy and simple.

There are multiple options for ZigBee support.  I opted for ZHA because it has
fairly good device support and is easy to use and set-up.

The alternatives are:

- [Zibgee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/)
  - Good for power users, execellent configuratbility and the best device support
  - It can be complicated.
- [deCONZ Add-On](https://dresden-elektronik.github.io/deconz-rest-doc/)
  - Made by the ConBee2 developers.  There are no real benefits to using
    this integration.

## Z-Wave automation

For Z-Wave I am using the
[Z-Wave JS](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js)
integration paired with a
[Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5](https://aeotec.com/products/aeotec-z-stick-gen5/).


I am using the
[Z-Wave JS UI](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave-js-ui)
from Community Add-ons because that gives you a control panel
user interface that is handy when debugging obscure Z-Wave issues and
also has support for creating direct node group associations.

In most day to day situations, I don't really use this control panel, as
most operations can be done from the [Home Assistant][ha] integration
directly.

When adding this, it is *not* possible to do it from the auto-discovered
*z-stick gen5* as that will automatically install the core Z-Wave JS add-on.
So just ignore it and use the `Add Integration` functionality and pick
`Z-Wave JS` integration from the menu.  This will let you skip the
standard add-on installation and let you specify the right Z-Wave JS UI add-on
instead.


## Other integrations

- [Buienradar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/buienradar) : Dutch
  weather data.  Just add it and it works mostly out of the box.
- [DLNA media servers](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dlna_dms) :
  these are discovered automatically as long as they are in the same Subnet.
- [Google Cast](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cast) :
  These are also discovered automatically.  Used for Android TV devices and
  Google Nest speakers/displays.
- [Printer](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ipp) : This was
  automatically discovered.
- [Waze Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/waze_travel_time) :
  Show the commute time between two points.
- [Netherlands Vehicle Authority](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rdw) :
  Yes, this can be done, but not sure its use.  Maybe to remind you that the APK
  is due?
- [Philips TV](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/philips_js/) :
  Installing this integration is quite straight forward.  This enables automation
  options, but I don't know what to do with it yet.  Also has the limitation that
  it can't be turned on using the API.
- [Jellyfin](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/jellyfin/) :
  Add a Jellyfin server as a media source.  Note that only a single Jellyfin
  can be configured.
