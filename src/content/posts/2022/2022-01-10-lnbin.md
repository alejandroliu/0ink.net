This is my [lnbin](${SNIPPETS}/lnbin) script.

This is a program for managing symlink in a `/usr/local/bin`
directory.  It is similar to stow, lndir, cleanlinks and
others.

The approach used by *lnbin* is based on Stow, and it is to install
each into its own tree, then use symbolic links to make its bin
directory, so that the command can be in the executable path.

When run, *lnbin* examines packages in `pkgs-dir` and the
`target` directory (see OPTIONS), adding or removing links as
needed.

# Sample usage:

## pkg installation

The standard way to use *lnbin* is:

- download source package
- build and install package

```bash
# extract archive
tar zxvf archive-x.x.tar.gz
cd archive-x.x
# GNU autoconf
./configure --prefix="/usr/local/pkgs/archive-x.x"
make
# Package installation
make install
# ... or ...
make install DESTDIR=/usr/local/pkgs/archive-x.x
```

- update symlinks in /usr/local

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin
lnbin -v update ../pkgs
```


## Removing packages

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/pkgs/archive-x.x
cd /usr/local/bin
lnbin -v update ../pkgs
```

## Updating symlinks

```
cd /usr/local/bin
lnbin -v update ../pkgs
```
This will add new links and/or remove obsolete links
