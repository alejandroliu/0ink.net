This is my [lnbin](https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/main/snippets/2022/lnbin) script.

This is a program for managing symlink in a `/usr/local/bin`
directory.  It is similar to stow, lndir, cleanlinks and
others.

The approach used by *lnbin* is based on Stow, and it is to install
each into its own tree, then use symbolic links to make its bin
directory, so that the command can be in the executable path.

When run, *lnbin* examines packages in `pkgs-dir` and the
`target` directory (see OPTIONS), adding or removing links as
needed.

# Sample usage:

## pkg installation

The standard way to use *lnbin* is:

- download source package
- build and install package

```bash
# extract archive
tar zxvf archive-x.x.tar.gz
cd archive-x.x
# GNU autoconf
./configure --prefix="/usr/local/pkgs/archive-x.x"
make
# Package installation
make install
# ... or ...
make install DESTDIR=/usr/local/pkgs/archive-x.x
```

- update symlinks in /usr/local/bin

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin
lnbin -v -x ../pkgs
```
This will add the new links (and also remove/update obsolete/changed links)


## Removing packages

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/pkgs/archive-x.x
cd /usr/local/bin
lnbin -v -x ../pkgs
```

## Updating symlinks (after upgrade)

```
cd /usr/local/bin
lnbin -v -x ../pkgs
```
This will add new links and/or remove obsolete links

# Handling additional files

For packages that install additional files like man pages
or desktop files you can use the commands:

```
lnbin -v -x -s share/man/man1 -t /usr/local/share/man/man1 ../../../pkgs
lnbin -v -x -s share/applications -t /usr/local/share/applications ../../pkgs
```

# References

There are a number of packages that do similar things.  The main
attractiveness of this one is that it is a `/bin/sh` script
intended to have low dependancies.

Other options:

- [stow: a perl program](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
- [spill: written C, so also has a low dependency count.](http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/spill/)
- [stash: a package manager for non-root users (in perl)](http://www.wyrick.org/source/perl/stash/)
- [lt: shell script by Marc Vertes.](http://mvertes.free.fr/lt/lt)

I chose not to use *lt* because while written in `/bin/sh`, I wanted
a script that could use relative links instead of absolute links.
