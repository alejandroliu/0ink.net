[NanoWiki][nw] is a Wiki implementation based on [picowiki][pw].

I have been using [SimpleNote][sn] for a number of years.  It works pretty well
but somehow I was looking for:

- Ability to include and render nice asciiart pictures
- Organizes articles in a folder structure.

So I was looking for a Wiki package that could either do this or be extended
to do this.

Other features that I was looking for:

- Use of [markdown][md] for markup, and be able to tweak the format as needed.
- Editor that would *syntax highlight* the markdown syntax
- Store data as simple files
- Written in a language I am familiar with.
- software generated network graphs (graphviz)

So, after looking at a number of packages, I opted for one that allthough
did not have all features, but it was small enough and easily extendable.

[PicoWiki][pw] is a very small Wiki implementation with a _plugin_
architecture, so it is quite easy to extend.  The downside of this
is that the functionality in [PicoWiki][pw] is quite limited.  So
I added the following features:

- file management: create, delete, rename, modify, attach, etc.
- hooks for access control
- meta data support
- Disabled code execution.  This can be considered a _"security"_ feature.
- Support for byte ranges.  This lets you stream video files directly
  from the wiki.
- toggable, folder or document views.
- theme support
- Multiple file type handling

The default installations has the following plugins:

- Emoji : Render emojis
- HTML : HTML content handler
- MarkDown : Markdown content handler
- Includes : Include Wiki documents in another
- Vars : Expand variables.  Either from document metadata or from the NanoWiki config file.
- WikiLinks : short hand for wiki links.
