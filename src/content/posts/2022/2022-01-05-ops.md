This is my [op](${SNIPPETS}/2022/opcmd) script.

This is stupidly simple script to elevate priviledges in order to
manage NFS shares on my QNAP NAS.

The idea is that NFS shares do `squash-root` so admin access is
disallowed through NFS.  This gives a convenient way to issue
root level commands without using NFS but instead use `ssh`
(and ssh authentication) to do this, which should provide
stronger security.

This script makes the following assumptions:

- the user has a `ssh-key` with admin access on the NAS.
- NFS is mounted using `autofs` and is on the `/net` virtual folder.

The way it works is that it uses the current working directory
when the command is launch.  It then resolves any symlink path and
check is the directory is in the `/net/` virtual folder so the
NFS server is the second component of the path.
