camera things.

[Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-as-low-cost-HD-surveillance-camera/) has a good tutorial on creating a low cost surveillance camera.

Essentially makes use of a Pi, the Camera module and fitted into one of those inexpensive fake surveillance cameras.

It uses [motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion) for the motion detection software.
