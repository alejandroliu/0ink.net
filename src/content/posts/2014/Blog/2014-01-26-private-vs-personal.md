In Microsoft Outlook has the option to tag e-mails with a sensitivity tag. Technically this is fairly meaningless. However sometimes I like to use them.  

The confidential tag is quite self explanatory. I always confuse what is the difference between private and personal.   So here is one possibility...

*   Personal information are things like preferences, political association, likes and dislikes.
*   Private information are things like bank account numbers. Stuff that you probably would like to keep secret.
