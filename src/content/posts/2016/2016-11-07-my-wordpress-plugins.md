For my own purposes I have written a number of WordPress plugins.

1. [S3Copy](https://github.com/iliu-net/S3Copy) - Makes backup copies of your pictures to an S3
   Compatible server.  I use [sirv.com](http://sirv.com) myself.  It also mangles <img /> tags so
   files are server from the S3 bucket.
2. [wptools](https://github.com/iliu-net/wptools) - A collection of WordPress related functionality.
3. [auto-content](https://github.com/iliu-net/auto-content) - A basic post from template plugin.
4. [simple-members-only](https://github.com/iliu-net/simple-members-only) - A fork of a defunct plugin.
