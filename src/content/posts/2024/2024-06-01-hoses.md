# Introduction

The [hose][hoses] is a python package that implements:

- socks5 proxy with SSL support
- netcat style cli to use the proxy
- simple stunnel implementation

For a project I had, I needed for remote systems to connect back to a central
management system over the Internet.  This provides a simple application level
proxy that implements this connectivity.

```lineart

                                         .-.      
+-----------+    +-------+            .-+   |          +--------+     +------------+
| Managment |    | SOCKS |        .--+       '--.      |  hose  |     | Management |
|           +----+       +-------|   Internet    |-----+        +-----+            |
|  Server   |    | Proxy |       |               |     | netcat |     |   agents   |
+-----------+    +-------+        '-------------'      +--------+     +------------+

```

Rather than re-inventing the wheel, it makes use of the [python SSL][pyssl] module 
to provide security and certificate based authentication.

The certificate authentication uses standard X509 certifcates as supported by
[OpenSSL][openssl].

Application proxy uses the [SOCKS][SOCKS], which is properly defined as [RFC1928][rfc].

As functionality goes, it focus mostly in connecting network sockets and in [netcat][nc]
functionality piping to running commands.

Access control can be defined in static files, but also it can be delegated to external
scripts or a REST API server.

# Features

The following is implemented:

- [SOCKS v5][SOCKS] protocol, with `CONNECT` and `BIND` commands.  It does *not* implement
  `UDP Associate` commands.  The Authentication handshake is performed, but no Authentication
  is implemented.  [hoses][hoses] expects the connection to be wrapped in a SSL/TLS stream
  and clients are authenticated using certificates at that level.
- As mentioned earlier, SSL/TLS is used to secure the application proxy and it is performed
  *before* [SOCKS][SOCKS] protocol starts running.
- The [SOCKS][SOCKS] protocol is further extended to allow connecting/binding to UNIX sockets.
- Proxy activity is logged in an optional _audit.log_.
- Access control is largely untested, but implemented as either:
  - script/command that runs in the background and accepts JSON requests with client data
    and returns `allow` or `deny`.
  - Or a combination of:
    - static access list
    - script that runs with environment variables containing request data and returns an access list
    - REST API endpoint that access JSON content and retunrs an access list.

In order to use the application proxy, [netcat][nc] type functionality is implemented
with the following features:

- Connect to remote hosts either directly or via [hoses][hoses] application proxy.
- Listen to incoming connections and spawn an external program.
- SSL/TLS wrapped connections with optional client certificate validation.
- Connections to TCP ports and UNIX sockets.

To facilitate securing legacy servers, [stunnel][tun] functionality is available:

- Port forwarding with optional SSL/TLS
- SSL/TLS wiht optional client certificate validation
 

# Where to find

The project is hosted on [github][hoses].


# Examples

## Proxy

The main usage is as a socks proxy.

Basic socks5 compatible proxy:

```bash
hoses -S * -P 1080 proxy
```
- `-S *` will listen on all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- `-P 1080` listen on port 1080

Enable TLS and listen only on loopback address:

```bash
hoses -S 127.0.0.1 -P 3340 --cert server.crt --key server.key
```
Enable TLS and enable client certificate verification:
- `--cert server.crt` : file path to server certificate
- `--key server.key` : file path to corresponding key.

```bash
hoses -S 127.0.0.1 -P 3340 --cert server.crt --key server.key --ca ca.crt
```
- `--ca ca.crt` Certificate file signing client certificates (or the client
  certificate itself for self-signed certificates.

## netcat server

It can be used as `netcat --listen` replacement.

Listen on localhost, port 4040 and run a command:

```bash
hose listen --exec localhost 4040 'sh -c "python3 eliza.py"
```

Listen on unix socket on the socks server, and forward
connections to port 22 on remotehost.  And persist bindings.

```bash
hose -S socks-server -P 1080 listen -p unix:/tmp/sshsock 0 remotehost 22
```

Like previous but with TLS:

```bash
hose -S socks-server -P 1080 --cert client.crt --key client.key --ca ca.crt listen -p unix:/tmp/sshsock 0 remotehost 22
```

## netcat client

It can be used as a netcat client to connect to network ports.

Connect to remote:
```bash
hose connect remotehost 4583
```

Connect to a remote TLS server with certificate based client authentication
```bash
hose --cert client.crt --key client.key --ca ca.crt connect remotehost 4583
```

Connect to a remote host through a SSL socks proxy with client authentication
```bash
hose -S socks-server -P 1080 --cert client.crt --key client.key --ca ca.crt connect remotehost 4583
```

## stunnel

This is used as a replacement for `stunnel`.

Accept TLS connections and forward them to a different port.  This is used
to provide TLS encryption to protocol servers that do not support this
out of the box.

```bash
hose --cert server.crt --key server.key listen --unwrap -p localhost 8011 remotehost 11
```

Accept unencrypted connection and forward them to a TLS server.  This is used to
give TLS encryption to protocol clients that do not support it out of the box.
```bash
hose --cert server.crt --key server.key listen --wrap -p localhost 11 remotehost 8011
```

## SSH tunnel
You can use it as an ssh proxy command to make ssh go through a Socks
proxy:

```bash
ssh -o "ProxyCommand hoses -S sockserver -P 1080 connect %h %p" remotehost
```
