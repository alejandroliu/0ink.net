After looking a multiple options of GUI programming under [python][python] I 
eventually settled for [tkinter][tkinter].  The main reason was that 
[tkinter][tkinter] is very ubiquitous and initially though the learning
curve wuld have shorter as I was very used to GUI programming using
[TCL/TK][tcl].  Turned out that known [TCL/TK][tcl] did not translate
very well to [tkinter][tkinter] in [python][python].

Also I found out some **BASIC** features that I was used to in [TCL/TK][tcl] were
not available in [python][python].  For example:

- Implementing optional scrollbars
- Scrollable frames
- Centering windows

At some time I considered using [kivy][kivy] but at the end, I did not.  Since the
main advantage for it is that you can create mobile apps.  But since my primary
phone is an iPhone, I don't think I would be able to create iPhone apps 
due to Apple's walled garden thing.
