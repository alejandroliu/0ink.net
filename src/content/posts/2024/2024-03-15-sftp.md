title: Locking down SFTP

This is a small recipe to increase the security around a SFTP interface.

In the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file include the following settings:

```text
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
```
This configures the sftp subsystem to use the internal sftp implementation.
This is because inside the chroot, we usually will not have the normal
`sftp-server` executable.

For each user that will be doing `sftp` do:

```text
Match User sftp-only-user-name
  ChrootDirectory /only/path
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  X11Forwarding no
  AllowTcpForwarding no
  PermitTTY no
```

Alternative you could do `Match Group` and have multiple sftp-only users in the
specified group.

The options are:

- `ChrootDirectory /only/path` : Note that this directory must have mode `0755` and be 
  owned by root.  If this is not the case, logins will fail with error: \
  `bad ownership or modes for chroot directory` \
- `ForceCommand internal-sftp` : Only allow `sftp`.  No other command will be allowed.
- `X11Forwarding`, `AllowTcpForwarding`, `PermitTTY` as `no` : These make sure that 
  the remote user doesn't try to open holes at the SSH protocol levels.
