How to reset your Fibit Charge 5, 6 or Fitbit Luxe?

You can reset your Fitbit Charge 5, Charge 6, or Fitbit Luxe in 2 ways:

* Soft reset: restart your Fitbit. You keep your data.
* Hard reset: revert to factory setting. Your data is removed from your Fitbit.

Method 1:

1. Swipe down from the start screen (with the clock face on it).
2. Go to _Settings._
3. Tap _Restart device._
4. Tap _Restart_ again.

Doesn't the restart solve anything? Follow the following steps.
**Note:** You will lose all your data:

1. Connect your Fitbit to your charger.
2. Press the button on the flat side of the charger 3 times. This flat piece is fixed to
   the USB-A connector. Wait 1 second after each press.
3. Wait 10 seconds until the Fitbit logo appears.
