As the last post of the year, I am posting my attempt at a simple "Single Page Application".

A **single-page application (SPA)** is a web application or website that interacts with the
user by dynamically rewriting the current web page, instead of the default method of loading
entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native
app.

In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load, or the appropriate resources
are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. 

From [wikipedia][wikipedia-spa] article.

For my simple **single-page application**, I wanted a web page that would present a form
that will let the user enter some input parameters, then click a button and a page
showing a QR code base on the input parameters will be displayed.  If the user were
to scan the QR code, then the page will be open showing some payload text and an optional
URL.

The **SPA** makes use of these libraries:

* [base32-js][base32]: Used to encode the URL to escape special characters.
* [qrcodejs][qrcodejs]: QR-code generation library

To make things easy for me, I chose to limit the javascript to only those
libraries and using only:

* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS

There is a single HTML that gets loaded at the beginning and contains all the 
interactive screens:

* Loading screen \
  Initial screen, usually gets replaced immediatly so you should hardly see it.
* home screen \
  Default screen, showing a form to get input parameters.
* qrdisplay screen \
  Screen showing the QR code
* error screen \
  Screen showing that decoding failed for some reason
* decoded screen \
  Screen showing the decoded QR code

On load all screens except for `Loading` are disabled (CSS style `display: none`).

After loading, `script.js` will check if the URL contains a `#` character
indicating there is a _fragment identifier_.  If found, it will decode
and show the contents of the _fragment identifier_.

If there was no _fragment identifier_, the home screen will be shown.

Note that all the interaction happens in the web browser.  Even entering the
URL with the _fragment identifier_, will only send the web page request
to the server.  The _fragment identifier_ remains local to the browser
and is never send to the network.

The script source can be found in [github][src].

You can check-it out in action in this [demo][demo].
