title: Why Ansible?

As part of an effort of standardising my home lab I decided to migrate my
ad-hoc configuration scripts into a more standard tool set.  So I looked at:

- [puppet][pup]
- [chef][chef]
- [saltstack][salt]
- [ansible][ansi]
- [cdist][cd]
- [cfengine][cfe]

At the end I opted for [ansible][ansi], as it was closer in operation to my
configuration scripts.  The main points for me where:

1. Central control node, with push semantics
2. No agent needed, all communications via `ssh`.  But it has `python` dependancies.
3. Written in `python`
4. Configuration mostly in YAML files.
5. Very wide acceptance in the IT community.

Later I found about [cdist][cd], while it is closer to my ad-hoc scripts, it is
a bit niche and not well known.  However, like [ansible][ansi] has a central
control node push model, all communications via `ssh` and has no `python`
dependancies, requiring only a compatible `shell`.

Configuration of [cdist][cd] is written in essentially `shell` scripts.  According
to [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdist#Similar_software):

> Ansible makes a distinction between roles, written in a declarative YAML-based
> language, and modules, written in Python. Cdist only has "types" which serve the
> purposes of both modules and roles and are mostly written in Bourne Shell. Cdist's
> approach might be preferable because Shell is familiar to many system
> administrators who have never used a configuration management system before,
> but Ansible's declarative language is arguably more readable and appropriate.

The remaining options all require agents, which is not ideal as I really wanted
a low footprint on the managed nodes.

[cfengine][cfe] has a nice theoretical framework but also, not as popular as
[ansible][ansi] or the other entries in this list.  While written in `C` it
uses a `DSL` for its configurations.

[puppet][pup] is written in a mix of of Ruby, Clojure and C++ and uses a DSL for
configuration.  [chef][chef] is written in a mix of Ruby and ERLAN and uses DSL
for Configuration.  Personally, I see the use of Ruby as a turn-off.  So far
several softwares I tried to use written in Ruby did not lead to good experiences
for me.

[saltstack][salt] is written in `python`.

# Removing Python as a dependancy

I am mostly using [Alpine Linux][alp] for servers.  As such, adding `python` adds
to a base image of 17.1MB, an additional 50MB.  So it is a bit unreasonable.  I found
a project [ansible-openwrt](https://github.com/gekmihesg/ansible-openwrt) which
removes the `python` dependancies but it has a lot of [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/).

I manage remove the OpenWRT dependancies, and the result can be found [HERE][nopython].

It makes use of the Ansible's [var_plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/vars.html)
functionality to hook into the `ActionBase._configure_module` method.

Also adds a number of modules written in `shell` script that replace the built-in python
modules.  Specially important are:

- setup: which is called automatically to gather facts at start.
- ping: because, it is the first thing to test things.
- stat: which is used by several modules specially copy.
- command: which is used by command and shell modules.

Interestingly enough, there are other modules such as `script` that do not have a python dependency.
