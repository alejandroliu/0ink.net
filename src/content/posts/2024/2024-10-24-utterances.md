Today I enabled comments on this blog.

You need to have an [github][gh] account in order to make comment.  This is because the 
main audience for this blog is developers and this should cut down on the spam.

Comments are stored [GitHub Issues][ghi] using the [Utterances][ut] comments widget.

I chose [Utterances][ut] because:

- it is lightweight
- makes use of the `issues` API, which at the moment should be more stable than the
  `discussions` API.
- Has its own bot, so there is no need to embed javascript with an app ID/secret.
