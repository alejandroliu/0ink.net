title: Replacing emacs...
---

So after over 30 years of using [GNU emacs][emacs] I have switched
to a more modern options.

So I am using:

- [Geany][geany]: For use in a Window environment (both X11 and MSWIN)
- [micro][micro]: For command line use
- [vi][busyboxvi]: For small environments

# Geany

[Geany][geany] is a nice programer's text editor.  I like that it has syntax
highlighting and has a modern UI.  It runs on Windows and Linux.

[Geany][geany] has most of the features that I would like without much
need of customization.  Most of the customization that I have
done is around the area of getting indentation right and the
use of `spaces` versus `tab` when indenting.  Specially when
writing [python][py] or [yaml][yaml] files where the indentation is
important.

A couple of featues that I thought were important but I am not
using much are:

- macro recording
- split screens

These features are available in geany as plugins, but I am not
using them.

# micro

A [micro][micro] is a modern, intuitive terminal based text editor.  It
follows modern key bindings and is fairly customizable.

Actually it works well straight out of the box, but I did some
customizations in order to look similar to [geany][geany], and
so that it would work well with [putty][putty].

This is my [bindings][bindings].json file:
