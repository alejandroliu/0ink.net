<p>As usual with any IT system backups are important. This does not change when using a free shared hosting provider. Because it is free, one would argue it is even more important.</p>
<p>For my wordpress web site I used something called <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/WordPress-CLI-Exporter">cli-exporter</a>. It let's you create "Wordpress" export files from the command line so it can be run from <code>cron</code>. This is important because backups <em>have</em> to be automated.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I copy the backup files to an off-site location. I do this by copying files using WebDAV to a storage provider. I did this by writing a simple script and using the PHP library <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/WebDAVClient">SabreDAV</a> which makes writing DAV clients quite easy.</p>
<p>I myself don't mind using other people's Open Source code to do something. I was actually surprised that I was not able to find something that meet my criteria. However, thanks to the power of open source I was able to find something that fit the bill exactly.</p>
<p>To make things more interesting, because I wanted to keep backup files as compressed Zip archives, my backup scripts did not work in one of the web hosts that I was using. They did not have the <code>zip</code> extensions enabled. This is surprising considering is quite standard. Luckily I was able to find a pure PHP library <a href="http://www.phpconcept.net/pclzip/">pclzip</a>.</p>
