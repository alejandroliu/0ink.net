</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>My ISP provider is <a href="https://www.kpn.com" title="KPN">KPN</a>.  They recently enabled
IPv6 in my street.  I was using before a IPv6 Tunnel Broker,
starting with <a href="https://www.sixxs.net" title="SixXS">SixXS</a> and after they went out,
with <a href="https://tunnelbroker.net" title="Hurricane Electric">Hurricane Electric</a>.  So naturally,
I decided to switch to KPN's native IPv6 service.</p>
<p>They provide a /64 prefix, which is reasonable.  Would be better
if they provided a /48, but /64 is better than other providers.</p>
<p>So to start using KPN as the IPv6 turned out very easy.  Their default
configuration works right out of the box if you have single flat
network.</p>
<p>I used to have a router/FW between the KPN modem and my network,
but at some point I decided to go for a flat network design.  With
this, (without having to do anything) once KPN enabled IPv6, all my
equipment that was IPv6 capable started using IPv6.  It was like
magic.</p>
<p>I run a number of server systems in my home network, using
<a href="https://alpinelinux.org" title="Alpine Linux">Alpine Linux</a> as its operating system.</p>
<p>For some reason, these servers would be able to use IPv6 at first
(either via static configuration or auto-configuration), but stop
working after a few minutes (often after 65 seconds).</p>
<p>Things worked fine for my <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">void-linux</a> systems.  These
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a> so I guess this helps.</p>
<p>Even googling around I was not able to find a solution.  Apparently
doing this would re-enable things:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ip -6 a del $ip6_addr dev $IFACE
ip -6 a add $ip6_addr dev $IFACE
</code></pre></div>

<p>So what I did is, I wrote a small little script that would run
every 45 seconds, and do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ip -6 address save dev $IFACE scope global &gt; $savefile
ip -6 address flush dev $IFACE scope global
ip -6 address restore &lt; $savefile 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -v &#39;RTNETLINK answers: File exists&#39; || :
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, I have no idea what is going on.</p>
<p>Eventually I changed my set-up to have something like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">+---------+</span><span class="c">   </span><span class="nb">+------+</span><span class="c">   </span><span class="nb">+------------+</span><span class="c"></span>
<span class="c">|KPN modem|</span><span class="nb">---</span><span class="c">|router|</span><span class="nb">---</span><span class="c">|HOME NETWORK|</span>
<span class="nb">+---------+</span><span class="c">   </span><span class="nb">+------+</span><span class="c">   </span><span class="nb">+------------+</span><span class="c"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>router</code> in between does Network Address Translation
and Firewalling.  The reasons I chose this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>More <em>natural</em> way of handling incoming connections</li>
<li>Makes it possible to switch ISP's easier, down the line.
  Alternatively, would make it possible to load-balance between
  two ISPs.</li>
<li>Can use <code>iptables</code> for firewally.  I recognize that this is
  only good for a geek like me though.</li>
</ul>
<p>This causes problems with my IPv6 set-up because
now I have two segments.</p>
<p>The KPN modem, assumes a flat network (with /64).  Since
I can't create routes in the KPN modem then the only
option would have been to NAT.  However the general
concensus is <strong>NOT</strong> to NAT IPv6.  See
<a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/ipv6-coe/ipv6-nat-you-can-get-it-but-you-may-not-need-or-want-it/">this article</a>
for example.</p>
<p>An alternative would have been to split the /64 into /80
segments.  Unfortunately, that doesn't work as a lot of the
software out there assumes that the network part of the IPv6
address is at most 64 bits.</p>
<p>Linux has a feature built-in to the kernel called <code>proxy_ndp</code>.
For <a href="https://vtluug.org/wiki/Proxy_NDP">example</a>,</p>
<p>The problem is that this does not scale well as the proxy address
needs to be statically configured.</p>
<p>There are daemons that claim to proxy NDP for ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DanielAdolfsson/ndppd">ndppd</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/setaou/ndp-proxy">ndp-proxy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These however did not work for me.</p>
<p>So I wrote my own script to manage kernel <code>proxy_ndp</code> entries
myself.  Essentially it does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>listen on <code>ip monitor</code> for IPv6 neighbor messages</li>
<li>add and remove kernel data</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole script can be found <a href="https://github.com/alejandroliu/0ink.net/blob/master/snippets/ipv6-whoes/ndpbr.sh">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use [dnsmasq][dnsmasq] and can
be found <a href="https://quantum2.xyz/2019/03/08/ndp-proxy-route-ipv6-vpn-addresses/">here</a>.</p>
<p>[dnsmasq]:</p>
