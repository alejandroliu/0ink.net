</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So we bough a Philips 50PFK6540.  This is a 50" TV with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambilight">Ambi Ligh</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_TV">Android TV</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted to do from the very start was to load my own APKs.  This was not
possible until a recent (2016) update that enabled the <strong>"Install from Unknown Sources"</strong>
setting option.</p>
<p>This made it possible to side load applications.  However, things are not as easy as I
initially thought.  Because while installing from unknown sources was possible, you can not
do this from the built-in browser.  So the procedure is as folows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to settings to enable <strong>Install from Unknown sources</strong>, which should be under
   <code>Security &amp;amp; Restrictions</code>.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a>
   from the Play Store.  A bit of a warning: on phones and tablets, ES File Explorer isn't something
   that is generally recommended as it used to be a reliable file manager that was one of the
   most valuable Android apps, but recently it became riddled with ads <em>many of which are highly
   intrusive) leading many users to uninstall it and websites to remove it from their </em>must have* lists.
   Fortunately, the Android TV app seems to have gone largely untouched by this, so it still is
   recommended it for the purpose of this tutorial.</li>
<li>Use ES File Explorer to download the APK you want to side load.  There is a number of ways to do
   this.  I used the built-in FTP server.  But you could use any method (i.e Thumb drive, Cloud
   Storage, etc...)</li>
<li>Open the APK from ES File Explorer and install it.</li>
</ol>
