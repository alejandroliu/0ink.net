</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last weekend I had a small weekend project to move my All-In-One Printer/Scanner from my Xen host server to a spare NAS200 I had lying around. Since the NAS200 has a i486 compatible CPU, and I had been able to run a CentOS 5 distro before, I figure it would make a good server with low power consumption.</p>
<p><img alt="nas200" src="/images/2013/linksys-nas200.jpg"></p>
<p>For that I updated my <a href="http://nascc.sf.net">NASCC firmware</a> so that it would boot a USB key, and update my CentOS image creation <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/nascc/wiki/centos/">script</a>. This worked well, I was able to boot CentOS without <em>that much</em> effort altogether.</p>
<p>I myself have an <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/epson-stylus-cx5500-339283304.htm">Epson Stylus CX5500</a> which unfortunately only comes with <a href="http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/?OSC=LX">binary drivers</a>. This was not much of a problem since the NAS200 has a i486 compatible CPU. I find this is relatively unique among different NAS models.</p>
<p>Alas, the performance was quite disappointing. I should be used to the NAS200 underperforming. But really, this was truly sad. I did not bother to test the printing, but I did try scanning with it. Running <code>scanimage</code> to scan a single page was taking over 15 minutes before I hit <code>Ctrl+C</code>.</p>
<p>It was an idea, but the results were so sub par. The only take-aways of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was able to run open source as well as binary blobs on a NAS200 relatively easily.</li>
<li>I was able to use CentOS5 pretty much out-of-the box. No recompiles required. Did notice though that <code>cups</code> would seg-fault. My guess is that the i386 package some how got some i686 optimizations on it.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nascc/files/LEC/">Linux Ethernet Console</a> made a very good network console. I was able to troubleshoot some very early boot problems with it.</li>
<li>NAS200 performance for scanning was abysmal.</li>
</ul>
