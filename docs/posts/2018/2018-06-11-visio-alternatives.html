		<p>Need to create diagrams, flowcharts, circuits, or other kinds of
entity-relationship models? Microsoft Visio is without a doubt the
best software for that, but that doesn't mean it's the best choice
<em>for you.</em></p>
<p>Visio may be the industry standard in the corporate world, but it
comes with a huge drawback: it's expensive ($299 for the standard
version as of this writing). Can't afford that? Then you 'll be happy
to know that several open source alternatives exist for the low, low
price of FREE.</p>
<p>We're going to highlight the two best ones here, but if you don't like
them for whatever reason, you can scroll down to the bottom of the
article for even more options to explore.</p>
<h3 id="diagram-creation-with-dia">Diagram Creation with Dia</h3>
<p><a href="http://dia-installer.de/">Dia</a> has been the go-to Visio alternative
for many years. What I like
most about it is the first impression that you get when it launches:
clean, simple, with an interface that's familiar and easy to navigate.
Quite reminiscent of Visio, in fact:</p>
<p><img alt="dia-1" src="/images/2018/dia-1.png"></p>
<p>You'll be able to create your first diagram in mere minutes.
Drag-and-drop a few symbols onto the canvas, then connect them using
the various types available in the toolbox: lines, zigzags, arcs,
circles, curves, etc.</p>
<p>Dia also supports layers, making it a lot easier to manage complex
charts, and moving elements between layers is as simple as hitting a
hotkey.</p>
<p>Snap to grid, easy resizing, text labels, image insertions -- Dia has
it all. Anything you can do in Visio can be done in Dia as well. The
only real downside is that Dia can't open Visio VSD files, but it can
handle most other diagramming formats like XML, EPS, and SVG.</p>
<p><em>Download -- <a href="http://dia-installer.de/">Dia</a></em> (Free)</p>
<h3 id="diagram-creation-with-libreoffice-draw">Diagram Creation with LibreOffice Draw</h3>
<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>? As far
as open source competitors to Microsoft Office go, you won't find a
more solid and robust alternative.</p>
<p>LibreOffice is far from perfect, but it's a respectable option for
fans of open source software. The app that should interest you is
<em>LibreOffice Draw</em>, the Visio counterpart in this office suite.</p>
<p><img alt="draw-1" src="/images/2018/draw-1.png"></p>
<p>LibreOffice Draw supplies two things for you: shapes and lines. You
use the shapes to represent diagram entities, and you use the lines to
connect them according to the entity relationships. It's perfect for
creating flowcharts, but you can do more with it if you want (like
desktop publishing or PDF editing).</p>
<p>First you have to open the Drawing toolbar, which you can do through
<em>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Drawing</em>. Grid snapping is on by default, but you'll
want to change the snapping sensitivity by going to
<em>Tools &gt; Options</em>, navigate to <em>LibreOffice Draw &gt; Grid</em>, change the
values under <em>Resolution</em> to your intended grid size, and change the
values under <em>Subdivision</em> to <em>1</em>.</p>
<p>LibreOffice is surprisingly easy to use once it's set up properly. You
can draw shapes, connectors, lines, curves, symbols, arrows, thought
bubbles, and even 3D objects. If you're already using LibreOffice as
your main office suite, forget Dia and learn to use Draw instead. The
learning curve isn't much worse at all, and you can use it for more
than just diagrams.</p>
<p><em>Download -- <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/">LibreOffice</a></em> (Free)</p>
<h3 id="other-alternatives-to-visio">Other Alternatives to Visio</h3>
<p>Dia and Draw may be the best available right now, but a quick web
search will turn up plenty of competitors that are just as good in
many ways. Keep in mind that these are NOT open source unless
specifically noted in the description.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yworks.com/products/yed">yEd Graph Editor</a> - Very similar
  to Dia, except much more powerful and proportionally harder to use.
  It has an automatic layout feature that can instantly rearrange a
  diagram to be clutter-free and more readable, which is fantastic for
  big and complex flowcharts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">LucidChart</a> - A very solid alternative
  to Visio in a lot of ways. It's web-based, so you can access it from
  anywhere, and packed full of features that make diagramming easy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a> - A no-login-required web-based
  diagramming tool that may not be the slickest in appearance, but
  can certainly get the job done. Diagrams can be saved to Dropbox,
  Google Drive, OneDrive, or locally. The interface is clean, the
  results are acceptable, and it's open source.</li>
</ul>
