		<p>Keep your data and accounts safe by using a secure open source
password manager to store unique, complex passwords.</p>
<p>Maintaining complex, unique passwords for each site and service you
use is among the most common pieces of advice that security
professionals provide to the public every year.</p>
<p>Yet no matter how many times it is said, it seems like a week doesn't
go by where a high-profile hacking story hits the news, revealing that
users of the service in question more often than not had such secure
passwords as "12345" or "password" as the only wall of protection on
their account.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a user offers up just enough variation on the classic
password selection to get past the minimal rules of the service.
Unfortunately, "Pa$$w0rd!" isn't secure in any meaningful way, either.
At this point, almost every variation of words and phrases strung
together with a few numbers or substitutions is simply too easy for a
password cracking tool to make its way through, and the shorter the
password, the easier.</p>
<p>The best passwords are long, random or pseudo-random combinations of
every possible character allowed, with a different password for each
unique use. But how could a normal person remember the hundreds or
even thousands of individual passwords associated with each account
they've ever created? The short answer is: they can't. And don't even
think about writing a password down in plain text, whether in the
physical world or the digital.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to keep track of these complex, unique
passwords is with a password manager, which provides easy access to
strong encryption. While proprietary commercial solutions like LastPass
are popular, there are several open source solutions as well. And with
passwords, being able to audit the source code of your password manager
is especially important, as it helps ensure that your passwords are
encrypted properly and are not vulnerable to backdoors.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here are a few open source password managers
we hope you will consider.</p>
<h3 id="keepass">KeePass</h3>
<p><a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> is a GPLv2-licensed password manager,
primarily designed for Windows but also running elsewhere. KeePass
offers multiple strong encryption options, easy exports, multiple
user keys, advanced searching features, and more. Designed for desktop
use, there are plugins that allow direct use from your web browser,
and it can run from a USB stick if you'd prefer to physically carry
your passwords from machine to machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a>, which started as a Linux port
of KeePass, is another project you may consider. KeyPassX is compatible
with KeePass 2 password files, and has also been ported to run on
different operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="padlock">Padlock</h3>
<p><a href="https://padlock.io/">Padlock</a> is a very new entrant into the world of
open source password managers. Currently available for Windows, Mac,
iOS, and Android, with a Linux client in the works, Padlock is
designed as a "minimalist" password manager. Its
<a href="https://github.com/MaKleSoft/padlock">source</a> is available on GitHub.
The project is also developing a
<a href="https://github.com/maklesoft/padlock-cloud">cloud backend</a>, also open
source, which will be a welcomed addition to anyone tired of managing
password files or setting up syncing across multiple computers.</p>
<h3 id="passbolt">Passbolt</h3>
<p><a href="https://padlock.io/">Passbolt</a> is another relatively new option, with
plugins available for Firefox and Chrome and mobile and command-line
options on the way. Based on OpenPGP, you can check out its online
<a href="https://demo.passbolt.com/auth/login">demo</a> which shows off some of
the features (you'll need to install the plugin for your browser, though).
You can check out the source code on <a href="https://github.com/passbolt">GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Using a password manager that you trust alongside complex passwords is
not a substitute for taking other security precautions, nor is it
foolproof. But for many users, it can be an important part of keeping
your digital life secured. These definitely aren't the only options
out there. There are some older options, like <a href="https://clipperz.is/">Clipperz</a>
and <a href="https://pwsafe.org/">Password Safe</a>, and web-based tools like
<a href="https://github.com/tildaslash/RatticWeb">RatticDB</a> that I would be
interested to try out.</p>
