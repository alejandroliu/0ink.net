		<p>In 2014, Microsoft <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clip-art-gone-heres-find-free-images-instead/">killed and buried Clipart</a>
in the digital graveyard.</p>

engines than Microsoft' somewhat limited supply through the Office
suite.</p>
<p>Today' clipart needs to be modern, colorful, and less cartoonish. An
online search for clip art images will net you files that are of far
better quality and relevance. But you need shortcuts when searching for
the right image is a daily workout.</p>
<p>These are <em>13 of the top websites</em> for free clipart downloads. Browse
through them and bookmark the ones that meet your needs.</p>
