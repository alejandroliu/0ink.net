<p><code>rpmgot</code> is a simple/lightweight software package download proxy. It was designed to run on an OpenWRT router with some USB storage. So it is fully implemented as an <code>ash</code> script.</p>
<p>The basic idea has been implemented multiple times. For example refer to this <a href="http://ma.ttwagner.com/lazy-distro-mirrors-with-squid/">article</a> on a <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">squid</a> based implementation.</p>
<p>Unlike squid, which once you include all its dependencies can use up over 1MB of space just to install it, this software has very few dependencies.</p>
<p>The idea is for small developers running the same operating system version(s) would benefit from a local mirror of them, but they don't have so many systems that it's actually reasonable for them to run a full mirror, which would entail rsyncing a bunch of content daily, much of which may be packages would never be used.</p>
<p><code>rpmgot</code> implements a <em>lazy</em> mirror something that would appear to its client systems as a full mirror, but would act more as a proxy. When a client installed a particular version of a particular package for the first time, it would go fetch them from a "real" mirror, and then cache it for a long time. Subsequent requests for the same package from the "mirror" would be served from cache.</p>
<p>The RPM files are cached for a very long time. Normally it is an awful, awful idea for proxy servers to do interfere with the <code>Cache-Control / Expires</code> headers that sites serve. But in the case of a mirror, we know that any updates to a package will necessarily bump the version number in the URL. Ergo, we can pretty safely cache RPMs indefinitely.</p>
