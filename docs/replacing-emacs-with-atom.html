<p>As an old UNIX guy I have been using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">emacs</a> for years.
So in a way, I am very comfortable with using it and most of keyboard
shortcuts. But, it really is an old animal and I have been thinking
that I should be moving to a more modern replacement to it for quite
a while.</p>
<p>My latest attempt (and the most serious attempt to date) has been
trying <a href="http://atom.io/">atom</a>. <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a> is a new
editor from the makers of <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> which claims
to have been inspired by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">emacs</a>
and also supports the latest web technologies.</p>
<p>After using it for some time, I found the following conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am really used to using CTRL + key to move around. And switching to the dedicated arrow and home/end keys feels like a step backwards. I might be old fashioned, but it really is about keeping your fingers in the keyboard "home" row. Also, while the arrow keys are easy to find, I have trouble with the home/end keys (which apparently I use a lot when programming). Specially because I switch between a laptop and full size keyboard all the time.</li>
<li>I really like the automatic programming style automation in Emacs.</li>
<li>I miss the record macro/execute macro facility of Emacs.</li>
<li>The automatic "(" inserts ")" really annoys me.</li>
<li>Browsing for extensions in "Atom" seems a bit non-intuitive to me.</li>
<li>I am used to using the command line and open the files in a running editor directly from there. I am able to configure emacs to do this, it is not clear to me how to do this with Atom yet.</li>
<li>I don't know why I am so used to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> CTRL+S (search) functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following things I really like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Syntax highlighting is quite solid</li>
<li>The project view pane is very useful.</li>
<li>The Markdown preview pane.</li>
</ol>
<p>So up to know, looks promising but I am not convinced. I still using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">emacs</a> specially because it sometimes feel that <a href="http://atom.io/">atom</a> is slow to start.</p>
